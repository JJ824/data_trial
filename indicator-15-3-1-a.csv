15353,30/12/2022,Jenny James,<p>Texas biotech firm create ‘gold hydrogen’ from depleted oil well residue</p>,"<p>The Environment Agency may be called on to weigh up the costs and benefits of this method and the technique would likely require regulation. The biotech company Cemvita Factory has created a concoction of bacteria and nutrients that can break down oil residue in disused bore holes. The breakdown process creates hydrogen and CO2. A recent small scale field test was a “huge success.” Cemvita hopes to produce hydrogen for $1 per kilogram, which would be competitive against other methods and estimates there are more than 1,000 depleted oil wells dotted around the United States that might be suitable. Cemvita’s goal is to treat oil wells with microbes to enable steady, long-term hydrogen production—conceivably lasting for decades. Existing, disused infrastructure around old oil wells, once used for collecting off-gasses, could be brought back into service to collect the hydrogen. It will, however, be important to prevent the CO2 by-product from leaking into the atmosphere. The hope is that the CO2 can be locked underground, using other microbes to fix it somehow, or find commercial uses for the greenhouse gas. Another potential issue is contamination with hydrogen-consuming microbes which would consume the hydrogen gas. There are also concerns around whether such technologies could potentially shore up fossil fuel firms, in contrast to hydrogen production systems that rely on renewables. </p>",<p>https&%2358;//www.wired.co.uk/article/gold-hydrogen</p>,<p>‘Gold Hydrogen’ Is an Untapped Resource in Depleted Oil Wells</p>,Wired,24/11/2022,CHRIS BARANIUK,,industry2,oil residue recuperation,,energy,,1 - operational work,3 - some development needed,2 - credible,<p>Hydrogen “Gold hydrogen” Bioengineering Biotechnology Oil “Oil well” “Residue oil” “Microbial breakdown” “Hydrogen production” Microbes Waste “Waste oil” Recycling Reuse “Oil treatment” “Oil breakdown”&%23160;</p>,No,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],30/12/2022 09:09,"James, Jennifer",30/12/2022 09:09,"James, Jennifer",0,,,,,Jenny James
15352,23/12/2022,Jenny James,<p>Photonics computing has the potential to provide high power computing at lower energetic cost.</p>,"<p>Photonic computing is a much more efficient process than electrical computing and could lower the energetic costs of computing, which will be important for achieving net zero. Photonics uses light rather than electricity to transmit signals, which is a much more efficient process and when applied to computing and has the potential to reduce power consumption and increase processor speed (something that is becoming more relevant in this world of big data). Photonic computers can be entirely optical (using light only) or electro-optical (light is used for specific tasks but electronic components are also used). All-optical systems have the added benefit that computing operations can be completed during data transfer, potentially removing the need for data storage. Currently, most of the commercially available photonics computing devices are electro-optical and use silicon as an optical medium. In the future a CMOS (complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor) like process could be used to create photonic and electronic circuits on the same wafer. The application of photonics goes beyond computing and photonic technology has already become dominant in communication, with the application of fibre optics. The improved efficiency of photonics could also be applied to improve datacentres and lidar sensing technologies. </p>",<p>https&%2358;//www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/11/221122221305.htm</p>,<p>Teaching photonic chips to 'learn'</p>,Science Daily,22/11/2022,Volker Sorger,"<p>https&%2358;//techhq.com/2022/11/photonic-chips-could-lighten-ai-carbon-footprint/</p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//photonicsuk.org/uk-photonics-2035-the-vision"">https&%2358;//photonicsuk.org/uk-photonics-2035-the-vision</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.caltech.edu/about/news/electronicphotonic-chip-sandwich-pushes-boundaries-of-computing-and-data-transmission-efficiency"">https&%2358;//www.caltech.edu/about/news/electronicphotonic-chip-sandwich-pushes-boundaries-of-computing-and-data-transmission-efficiency</a></p><p>https&%2358;//www.nextplatform.com/2022/03/10/talking-silicon-photonics-signal-and-noise-with-andy-bechtolsheim/</p>",energy,efficiency level,,industry2,,1 - operational work,3 - some development needed,1 - Highly credible,<p>Photonics Optics “Photonic computing” “Optical computing” Electro-optical” “Novel computing” “Energetic cost” Carbon “Net zero” Technology Computing </p>,No,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],23/12/2022 11:30,"James, Jennifer",23/12/2022 11:30,"James, Jennifer",0,,,,,Jenny James
15351,21/12/2022,Jenny James,<p>Rapidly melting glaciers are releasing a staggering amount of unknown bacteria. </p>,"<p>The Environment Agency and partners should be aware of potential new sources of disease and anti-microbial resistance as well as drivers of ecosystem damage. Research on glacial runoff from Aarhus University studied 10 sites across the Northern Hemisphere. The findings showed that continued global warming over the next 80 years could release hundreds of thousands of tonnes of bacteria into environments downstream of receding glaciers. Microbes entombed inside glaciers could be a rich source of useful, new compounds, such as antibiotics. However, the researchers behind this new study say melting glaciers are releasing tonnes upon tonnes of bacteria faster than scientists can possibly catalogue them. In addition, this microbial input is concerning from an ecosystem and public/ animal health perspective with unknown bacteria entering sensitive ecosystems or catchments used by communities that depend on glacial runoff as a water source. Individual strains of bacteria were not studied, instead the researchers estimated their combined biomass. This meant they could not identify particular species that might pose a threat to human health – nor could they determine whether microbes were active, dormant, damaged, or dead. </p><p>This release of bacterial biomass is calculated to be the equivalent of 650,000 tonnes of carbon released per year into rivers, lakes, fjords, and oceans across the Northern Hemisphere. On top of this, bacteria and algae found in icy environments often contain pigments to shield themselves from damaging sunlight. But these pigments, in absorbing solar energy, could add to warming that is already accelerating glacial ice loss.</p>",<p>https&%2358;//www.sciencealert.com/rapidly-melting-glaciers-are-releasing-a-staggering-payload-of-unknown-bacteria?utm_source=ScienceAlert</p>,<p>Rapidly Melting Glaciers Are Releasing a Staggering Payload of Unknown Bacteria</p>,Science Alert,22/11/2022,CLARE WATSON,,climate,climate change impact,,"natural areas, landscape, ecosystems",,4 - possible future remit,2 - near to realisation,1 - Highly credible,<p>Bacteria Glacier Meltwater “Bacterial load” Microbes Ecosystem “Geochemical cycling” “Climate change” “Global warming” “Glacial melt” Ecosystem Contamination Carbon “Global water cycle” “Water cycle”</p><p>&%23160;</p>,No,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],21/12/2022 17:27,"James, Jennifer",21/12/2022 17:26,"James, Jennifer",0,,,,,Jenny James

While the plants themselves didn’t come into contact with sunlight, the energy used in the electrolyzing process came from renewable energy in the form of solar panels. However using the sun’s energy in this way meant that overall the process was more efficient than biological photosynthesis.

15347,13/12/2022,Jason Dinsdale,<p>A growing interest in nuclear power to help the World transition away from fossil fuels and make domestic provision more resilient may be baking future geopolitical tensions into the energy supply market.</p>,"<p>As a regulator of radioactive materials and waste the Environment Agency should be interested in considering how future resource supply issues could impact on the energy landscape. The upsurge of interest in nuclear power has in turn increased demand for uranium, widely used as nuclear fuel. While most nuclear power generation takes place in the USA and Europe, global uranium ore reserves tend to be located elsewhere, including Australia, China, Kazakhstan, Russia, India and African countries. The dramatically falling costs of renewable energy up until recent times has meant that global interest and investment has moved away from nuclear power and uranium prices fell considerably. But recent geopolitical developments, including Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, have renewed interest in nuclear power as a reliable alternative energy source to fossil fuels, and prices have once again risen, leading to greater competition for uranium resources. As with other resources such as oil, increasing demand collides geopolitics with economics. There is a risk that cost could trump resilience, locking nuclear power into fragile supply chains with potentially hostile actors and territories. Conversely it may provide a springboard for unlocking new supply chains with new producers, but this in turn could present wider ethical and environmental concerns, as with expanding extraction of cobalt and lithium have demonstrated, and as Niger exemplifies with uranium itself. New reserves of uranium recently discovered in China using a new remote sensing method may suggest that there are other new potential supplies out there, but again this expansion may help to keep uranium economically affordable but with significant environmental costs. Energy policies and their consequences for suppliers, regulators and societies may need careful consideration in the light of these developments around uranium to ensure that the same fragilities exposed by recent systemic shocks are not repeatedly built into fossil fuel alternative energy supplies.</p>",<p>https&%2358;//www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/uranium-risks-becomingthe-next-critical-mineralscrisis/2022/09/04/bd604692-2c9d-11ed-bcc6-0874b26ae296_story.html</p>,<p>Uranium risks becoming the next critical minerals crisis</p>,Washington Post,05/09/2022,"Fickling, D","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.forbes.com/sites/arielcohen/2022/09/16/a-nuclear-renaissance-means-more-competition-for-uranium/?sh=2db332bd6275"">A Nuclear Renaissance Means More Competition For Uranium (forbes.com)</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//interestingengineering.com/science/china-reportedly-found-uranium"">China Uranium reserves&%2358; China reportedly found massive amounts of uranium at a depth of 10,000 feet (interestingengineering.com)</a></p>",energy,nuclear energy,,resources,non-ferrous metal,1 - operational work,1 - realised,2 - credible,<p>energy resources regulation uranium nuclear politics supply ore pollution oil lithium cobalt mining Congo Kazakhstan China Russia Australia India Africa UK Europe Ukraine Niger ethics fossil fuel market</p>,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],13/12/2022 14:03,"Dinsdale, Jason",13/12/2022 14:03,"Dinsdale, Jason",0,,,,,Jason Dinsdale

In a closed system a ‘bipolar membrane electrodialysis’ (BPME) manipulates seawater pH. Cyanobacteria are grown in low pH water, leading to increased CO2 uptake as they photosynthesise. High pH water created by the BPME is then used to precipitate the carbon (using microbes as nucleation seeds) which can then be removed from the water via sedimentation and filtration and used for biocement. </p>",<p>https&%2358;//www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(22)01428-6</p>,<p>Biocement from the ocean&%2358; Hybrid microbial-electrochemical mineralization of CO2</p>,i Science,16/09/2022,Atsu Kludze ,,climate,ocean-air interface,,industry1,,1 - operational work,3 - some development needed,1 - Highly credible,<p>Biocement “Carbon sequestration” “Carbon utilisation” “Net zero” “Alternative material” “Carbon removal” “Ocean chemistry” “Dissolved inorganic carbon” “Ocean carbon”</p>,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],03/11/2022 16:14,"Dinsdale, Jason",28/10/2022 15:40,"James, Jennifer",0,,,,,Jenny James

This court hearing could feed in to the ‘back to the office’ narrative being pushed by some businesses and also raises questions around the balance between employee productivity and ethics of monitoring home workers. In the hearing, Florida based company Chetu demanded a Dutch employee turned on their webcam for monitoring purposes for the full “9-hour workday.” When they refused to do so they were fired for what the company stated was “refusal to work” and “insubordination.” The Dutch court however ruled that “instructions to keep the webcam turned on is in conflict with the respect for the privacy of the workers.” In its verdict, the court goes so far as to suggest that demanding webcam surveillance is a human rights violation. The verdict sets a precedent for the level of employee monitoring that is considered ethical in Europe.

The team of researchers from Bristol and University College London used brown seaweed to produce cellulose nanomaterials. Fibres containing these seaweed-derived nanomaterials not only stop crystals from the sodium electrodes penetrating the separator, they also improve the performance of the batteries. First author Jing Wang said “We have shown that seaweed-based materials can make the separator very strong and prevent it being punctured by metal structures made from sodium.

As Europe continues to experience an ageing demographic there is a need to recognise the health and wellbeing issues that come with an ageing workforce. While other biological phenomena are increasing recognised in legislature, such as Spain recently introducing menstrual leave (%2315296), the menopause has until recently been a subject of stigma. The physical and mental impacts of the menopause can include hot flushes, night sweats, insomnia, fatigue, anxiety, mood changes and ‘brain fog’, all of which could impact on workplace performance and wellbeing. Some of these symptoms can have a debilitating effect for years. Currently no European country has policies to address the impact of the menopause in the workplace, such as menopausal leave. However some are taking steps to address this. A group of UK MPs are campaigning for the menopause to be a protected chracteristic, recognising that failing to address the issue in the workplace could push talented women out of work, &%23160;after a report showed the UK is currently “haemorrhaging talent”. The report also called for government to amend the Equality Act accordingly to include a duty for employers to provide reasonable adjustments for menopausal employees. It also called for a pilot menopausal leave scheme to be trialled in the public sector. As with similar situations there is great potential for the Environment Agency to embrace changing approaches to menopausal leave early and lay the foundations for its introduction. There are also potential risks to privacy, equality, recruitment and progression if its implementation does not happen in the right way, impacting negatively on workplace demographics.</p>",<p>https&%2358;//www.euronews.com/next/2022/10/18/menopause-leave-is-it-time-to-break-stigma-around-menopause-in-the-workplace</p>,<p>Menopause leave&%2358; Is it time for new legal rights to break the stigma in the workplace?</p>,Euronews,20/10/2022,"Carbonaro, G",<p>https&%2358;//www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jul/28/mps-call-for-menopause-to-be-protected-characteristic-in-uk-equality-act</p><p>&%23160;</p>,"social aspects, population",employment,,human health,,1 - operational work,2 - near to realisation,2 - credible,<p>health employment employee employer legislation woman women menopause menstrual period leave Spain UK MP workforce health wellbeing safety</p>,No,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],21/10/2022 12:25,"Dinsdale, Jason",21/10/2022 12:25,"Dinsdale, Jason",0,,,,,Jason Dinsdale

The patent for the process was granted in 2014, and since then the company, called Lumos Laboratories, have been partnering with the Nigerian government to develop real world applications of the technology, which can also be used to convert urine waste into flammable gases and biomethane. Byproducts are also used to manufacture flame resistant paints. The technology is currently being applied to waste from correctional facilities to enable them to produce their own energy and cooking gas while at the same time reducing the impact of human waste on the local area. It is calculated that the potential of this technology from the quantity of animal waste Nigeria generates could produce over 10,000 Megawatts of electricity, though the practicalities of achieving this are not discussed. A Canadian company recently acquired Lumos, suggesting wider deployment could occur. Urine has previously shown potential as a construction material (%2314761) and agricultural fertiliser (%2312331), providing that an adequate means of separation and collection can be achieved. However urine has been shown to carry some persistent substances (%2313564), which could mean that any waste generated from using urine in this way may need regulating. Using urine and biowaste in this manner could also mean a decentralisation of energy production, particularly at farm level in a similar manner to aerobic digestion (AD), which already falls under Environment Agency regulations, suggesting additional regulatory burden.</p>",<p>https&%2358;//guardian.ng/features/generating-electricity-cooking-gas-from-urine-biodegradable-waste/</p>,"<p>Generating electricity, cooking gas from urine, biodegradable waste</p>",The Guardian (Nigeria),18/03/2021,"Onyedika-Ugoeze, N","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.ammoniaenergy.org/articles/ammonia-production-from-waste-nigerian-rd-acquired-by-hydrofuel/"">Ammonia production from waste&%2358; Nigerian R&amp;D acquired by Hydrofuel – Ammonia Energy Association</a></p>",energy,bioenergy production,sustainable bioenergy production,waste,,1 - operational work,2 - near to realisation,3 - less credible,<p>waste fuel energy gas biofuel biogas hydrogen urine regulation Nigeria Canada &quot;Lumos Laboratories&quot; biomethane flammable resistant paint by-product animal waste farm agriculture decentralisation AD &quot;anaerobic digestion&quot; chemical persistent</p>,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],20/10/2022 17:04,"Dinsdale, Jason",20/10/2022 16:50,"Dinsdale, Jason",0,,,,,Jason Dinsdale

Shorter working weeks also potentially mean that work would be more evenly distributed, lowering unemployment rates, while reducing stress levels and improving productivity.

Increasing commercial and governmental activity in space has led to increased risks from space junk with the potential to impact satellite technology and other functions. Through its Artemis missions, NASA plans to return humans to the moon as soon 2025. This time, it wants to establish a long-term presence there, so astronauts have plenty of time to explore the lunar surface and conduct research that could one day help us reach Mars. Astronauts will need a reliable source of power while on the moon, and while solar panels can help meet that need, they won’t work during the long lunar nights or underground — and subterranean lava tubes are among the moon’s most scientifically intriguing features. The reactors would need to be lightweight and capable of continuously providing astronauts with 40 kilowatts of power — enough for 30 households here on Earth — for 10 years. They would also need to be ready for an actual demonstration on the moon by 2031.

The readily adoptable, scalable method introduces a closed-loop strategy that could globally reduce plastic waste and cut carbon emissions tied to plastic production. Researchers at the Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory have applied &quot;click&quot; chemistry to convert the chemical makeup of ABS into a ‘vitrimer.’ Vitrimers are a class of renewable plastics, which are derived from thermosetting polymers. This type of polymer combines the processability and recyclability of thermoplastics with the superior mechanochemical properties of thermosets, such as epoxy. The synthesis uses widely available medical compounds that are mixed in a single step under mild conditions, followed by curing with heat. Results show upcycled ABS achieved approximately double the toughness and strength of standard ABS, with enhanced solvent resistance. The processed ABS can be used in fused filament fabrication and overcomes the major challenge of “(re)printing cross-linked materials and produces stronger, tougher, solvent-resistant three-dimensional objects directly reprintable and separable from unsorted plastic waste”.

GPT-3 is well known for its ability to create humanlike text, but it’s not perfect. Even so, it has written a news article, produced books in 24 hours and created new content from deceased authors. Similar algorithms are used by tech companies for chat-boxes and autocomplete services, but the companies that create these algorithms are secretive about their inner-workings. AI has been flagged in the past for exacerbating inequality by analysing overly simplified, real-world data that over looks more nuanced factors. For example, an algorithm used to predict whether criminals were likely to re-offend was found to be heavily biased against black people leading to black people receiving much harsher sentencing. AI is also getting better at modelling human behaviour. Even simple algorithms are able to adjust the content that you see based on things you have interacted with in the past. Coupling this with an ability to generate text leads to a concerning possibility that AI could generate addictive content that feeds a person’s world view by creating reports that confirm their biases.

15319,03/08/2022,Jenny James,"<p>Numerous organisations have been experimenting with alternatives to the typical five-day, 40 hour weeks in attempts to improve staff wellbeing without compromising productivity.</p>","<p>The Environment Agency should consider emerging work-force trends, both to attract new talent and to improve staff welfare and productivity, particularly for neurodivergent people. An alternative to reducing the number of days worked per week is reducing the number of hours worked per day. The 4-hour workday is based on the premise that people are only truly productive for a certain number of hours each day, and that trying to work beyond that is counterintuitive. One study of UK office workers concluded that a majority of workers are only productive for two hours and 53 minutes per day. Proponents of the 4-hour workday believe that people should work when their energy is at its peak, and they should focus on a single task. The 40-hour working week can be seen as a relic from the industrial revolution when most work was manual. But this routine is nonsensical when work is largely cognitive. In recent times, work culture in many fields has led to people working long hours, either because of the logic that that more hours guarantees more work or out of a desire to show ambition and drive. However, pilot tests of the short working day have indicated that productivity actually increases with several recent studies indicating that workers’ focus and productivity tend to plunge after about five hours of work. In Europe, the Netherlands, Denmark and Norway have the shortest working week, with an average of 32.7 hours per week against the standard average of 40 hours per week in 2021. All three countries rank among the top countries in the world with the highest levels of productivity. The four-day work week has long been proposed to improve staff welfare, increase productivity and benefit the environment (%237978). Trials of four-day working weeks have been hailed as successes, with employees given the opportunity jumping at the chance to have an extra day to themselves (%2315217, %2315270). However, the Spanish company Telefonica struggled to get staff to sign up to their four-day scheme. Reasons suggested include the fact that Telefonica’s scheme came with a reduced salary. It’s also suggested that younger employees may reject the voluntary scheme as it could be viewed as counterproductive to progression, whereas older employees would be more comfortable with the compromise. The Centre for Cities think tank is also expecting post-pandemic experiments in working practices to recede, with five-day office weeks to becoming the norm again by the middle of 2023. </p>",<p>https&%2358;//www.scienceabc.com/humans/the-4-hour-workday-why-you-should-only-work-4-hours-instead-of-8.html</p>,<p>The 4-Hour Workday&%2358; Why You Should Only Work 4 Hours Instead of 8?</p>,Science ABC,08/07/2022,Akash Peshin,"<p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.euronews.com/next/2022/07/15/heres-why-a-four-day-working-week-trial-in-spain-has-not-been-a-runaway-success"">https&%2358;//www.euronews.com/next/2022/07/15/heres-why-a-four-day-working-week-trial-in-spain-has-not-been-a-runaway-success</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-57339105"">https&%2358;//www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-57339105</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.euronews.com/next/2022/07/27/is-the-6-hour-workday-the-answer-to-a-better-work-life-balance?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=next_newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=next&amp;_ope=eyJndWlkIjoiZWJlNTE1ZmUyYTJhZTQ1NjM5ODg1MjEzOTY3MmM3MTkifQ%3D%3D"">https&%2358;//www.euronews.com/next/2022/07/27/is-the-6-hour-workday-the-answer-to-a-better-work-life-balance?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=next_newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=next&amp;_ope=eyJndWlkIjoiZWJlNTE1ZmUyYTJhZTQ1NjM5ODg1MjEzOTY3MmM3MTkifQ%3D%3D</a></p><p>https&%2358;//metro.co.uk/2022/04/03/could-a-four-hour-work-day-make-us-more-productive-i-gave-it-a-go-16378826/</p>","social aspects, population",working hours,,"social aspects, population",workplace,4 - possible future remit,2 - near to realisation,2 - credible,<p>Workforce “Working week” “Workforce planning” “Changing workforce” “4-day working week” “4-hour day” “6-hour day” Productivity Focus “Work force trends”&%23160;“Work-life balance”</p>,No,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],03/08/2022 15:05,"James, Jennifer",03/08/2022 12:24,"James, Jennifer",0,,,,,Jenny James

This new field of necrobotics, in which biotic materials are used as robotic components, utilises designs perfected through evolution to perform simple mechanical tasks. The lab specializes in soft robotic systems that often use non-traditional materials, as opposed to hard plastics, metals and electronics. Deceased arthropods act as a readymade articulating form that is easier to produce than constructing a synthetic mechanical gripper of the same scale. Potential uses include pick-and-place tasks, repetitive tasks like sorting or moving objects around at these small scales, and maybe even assembly of microelectronics or deploying it to capture smaller insects in nature, because it’s inherently camouflaged. The wolf spider gripper produced for this research can lift 1.3 times its own weight, exert a peak gripping force of 0.35 millinewton, and can actuate at least 700 times before the limbs or the valve system start to degrade in any significant way.

The bacteria perform better when oxygen is available, so the company is also pulsing electricity through the soil at the injection wells. The electricity splits water molecules, releasing hydrogen and oxygen. The reduction in PFAS contamination at wells without the electrical treatment is around 60 per cent. Existing methods to deal with PFAS contamination are expensive and inadequate, including physically moving contaminated soil to a landfill site, where it can leach out. Incineration is another option, although this produces toxic hydrogen fluoride gas. Existing methods are especially impractical for sites with low concentrations of PFAS. Often called forever chemicals, PFAS have been found in drinking water (%2314130) and in people’s blood all over the world. Some types have been linked to health issues like kidney disease, cancer and severe covid-19. In Maine, there are reports of farmers dumping milk due to PFAS contamination from fertiliser.</p>",<p>https&%2358;//institutions.newscientist.com/article/2327968-biotech-firm-electrocutes-soil-so-bacteria-can-eat-forever-chemicals/</p>,<p>Biotech firm electrocutes soil so bacteria can eat ‘forever chemicals’ </p>,New Scientist,12/07/2022,James Dinneen,,chemistry1,chemical decontamination,,chemistry2,,1 - operational work,3 - some development needed,1 - Highly credible,<p>PFAS PFOA PFOS “Forever chemicals” Bioremediation Biotechnology Contamination “PFAS digestion” Bacteria “Bacterial breakdown” “Persistent environmental contaminants” </p>,No,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],28/07/2022 10:22,"James, Jennifer",28/07/2022 10:22,"James, Jennifer",0,,,,,Jenny James
15314,27/07/2022,Jenny James,"<p>Researchers have quantified the financial damage caused by a nation’s emissions, with the US calculated as having inflicted $2tn of damage on other countries.</p>","<p>The Environment Agency as a regulator of polluting industries might be held partially accountable for the $245bn of damages caused by UK emissions. The UK is number 11 on the list of most damaging countries and given that there is a move toward holding companies and governments accountable for their carbon emissions (%2315244, %2315116) it is possible that the UK government might one day have to pay compensation. The research hopes to “lift the veil of deniability” by combining historical data with climate models of varying complexity in an integrated framework to quantify each nation’s culpability for historical temperature-driven income changes in every other country. The Dartmouth researchers combined a number of different models, showing factors such as emissions, local climate conditions and economic changes, to ascertain the precise impact of an individual country’s contribution to the climate crisis. They looked for these links over a period spanning 1990 to 2014. Quantitatively assessing individual nations facilitates conversations around equity-based compensation for the damages caused. It can also inform legal discussions around liability claims. Greenhouse gasses have caused harm to other, mostly poor, countries through increased climate volatility, causing a range of damage including heatwaves, crop failures and powerful storms. Wealthy nations, especially those in northerly latitudes such as the UK and USA have disproportionally contributed to emissions but have not yet been severely harmed by it. The research excluded factors not included in GDP, such as biodiversity loss, cultural harm and deaths from disasters, meaning the damage is, in reality, far greater.</p>",<p><u>https&%2358;//www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/12/us-carbon-emissions-greenhouse-gases-climate-crisis</u></p>,<p>Nearly $2tn of damage inflicted on other countries by US emissions</p>,The Guardian,12/07/2022,Oliver Milman,<p>https&%2358;//link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-022-03387-y</p>,"social aspects, population",developing country,,climate,,4 - possible future remit,5 - conceptual,2 - credible,<p>“Climate crisis” “Climate change” “Climate damage” “Greenhouse gas” Emissions “Climate accountability” Liability Compensation “Financial cost” “Economic damage” “Economic compensation”</p>,No,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],27/07/2022 14:14,"James, Jennifer",27/07/2022 14:14,"James, Jennifer",0,,,,,Jenny James

Running Tide states that their nature-based solution provides an initiative for mitigating climate change, and that this is an excellent tool for the carbon market. Carbon sequestration is realised with the help of tens of thousands of small, floating kelp rafts, the growing kelp captures carbon and eventually sinks after six to eight months, taking the carbon to the ocean floor for ever. Critics of this carbon-removal initiative claim that there is not enough research about the possible harmful effects, that this activity is novel and hence poorly regulated, and that Running Tide is not taking ecological concerns seriously enough. Some of their practices such as ocean fertilisation are highly controversial as they add nutrients to the ocean to stimulate macroalgal growth. Nevertheless, Iceland has just signed a five-year contract with Running Tide to follow Maine’s example.

The court dismissed all of 3M’s arguments, one of which was based on 3M’s stated fear of potential liability for PFAS remediation expenses, as a leading manufacturer of the PFAS-containing compounds and products that caused PFAS contamination. The court ruled that regardless of the MCL, the New York Attorney General would be able to bring a lawsuit for PFAS contamination of public water resources, as if a defendant contaminates drinking water, it can be held liable regardless of whether or not there is an MCL in place for that contaminant&%2358; in effect the regulation does not create itself any potential liability.

US teenager Aseel Rawashdeh's innovation has developed a larvicide targeted at controlling disease carrying mosquitoes, but leaving other beneficial mosquitoes unaffected, from baker’s yeast and essential oils. Basing her research on a previous paper that used an essential oil carrying yeast to control termite populations by killing cellulose-digesting protozoa in the termite gut, Rawashdeh hypothesised that mosquitoes, which feed on wild yeasts in the water as juveniles, &%23160;could be targeted in a similar manner. Other previous research also revealed that essential oils from the <em>Piper</em> species of plants were effective against disease carrying <em>Aedes</em> mosquitoes, which had become immune to pyrethroid pesticide treatment. Through experimentation using a variety of combinations of essential oils and mosquito species larvae, Rawashdeh found a combination that created neurotoxicity for <em>Aedes</em> larvae alone, leaving all other test species unaffected. Her essential oil and yeast based larvicide costs around $10 a pound, and has a toxicity concentration of LD50, meaning it is effective at killing less than 50 percent or half of the mosquito larvae in a concentration of 50 milligrams per litre. Essential oil based pesticides are already used for addressing agricultural pests in some countries, namely USA and Australia. However, lack of support from regulatory agencies has been connected to commercial use lagging behind promise. Other recent research has demonstrated that non-target insects, some of which are beneficial pollinators, are exposed to lethal levels of insecticide through feeding on honeydew. This contributes to making a case for non-toxic chemical solutions to pest control (such as essential oils) needing greater research and regulatory support.

15304,13/07/2022,Jenny James,<p>MIT researchers have developed a new form of geo-engineering for tackling climate change – ‘space bubbles’. </p>,"<p>Emerging geoengineering solutions are important from an environmental risk perspective, as a form of mitigation that does not address the root cause of climate change and could have unforeseen environmental consequences. Consisting of a thin-film silicon structure and manufactured in outer space they could reflect 1.8% of the solar radiation, reducing temperature increases driven by climate change. By creating a raft of thin-film silicon bubbles deployed from Earth into outer space and stretching to the size of Brazil, they could potentially block the Sun’s solar radiation from further warming Earth. “Unlike other Earth-based geoengineering efforts, such as dissolving gases in the stratosphere for increasing its albedo effect, this method would not interfere directly with our biosphere and therefore would pose less risks to alter our already fragile ecosystems,”. The raft would be suspended at the ‘Lagrangian Point’, the location between the Earth and the Sun where the gravitation influence of both bodies cancel out. The team suggests having some sort of system to ensure the raft stays in place and that may provide the ability to move the bubbles closer to the Sun for optimal impact.

15303,11/07/2022,Jenny James,<p>New research on the impacts of adding hypersaline water from desalination plants to coastal water has found that some fish are attracted to these areas. </p>,"<p>The Environment Agency may want to consider this research in relation to regulating the treatment of saline wastewater, for example after road after road gritting, as well as in the regulation of Thames Water desalination plant. Desalination facilities typically discharge excess salt as hypersaline brine back into the ocean, with uncertain ecological effects. Now, researchers in Environmental Science &amp; Technology report that a large desalination plant in Australia has the unexpected benefit of attracting some species of fish, increasing their abundance at the discharge site. However, the physiological impacts of the hypersaline discharge have not been investigated. &%23160;Scuba divers took videos of fish at the outlet sites over a 7-year period before and after the desalination plant's operation, as well during a timeframe when the plant temporarily ceased operations. Fish, including some commercially important species, were three times more plentiful around the outlet during hypersaline discharge than before or after. The largest increase was observed for fish, such as the one-spot puller, that feed on zooplankton. The researchers hypothesise that the turbulence caused by the high-pressure release of the salty solution could have attracted the fish. Although the findings show that fish are attracted to the outlets, the physiological impacts of the hypersaline discharge have not been investigated. </p>","<p>&%23160;</p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/810547"">https&%2358;//www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/810547</a></p>",<p>Australian desalination plant attracts fish</p>,EurekAlert!,18/12/2019,,,water1,marine biota,,water1,water salinity,1 - operational work,3 - some development needed,2 - credible,<p>Hypersaline “Waste water treatment” “Waste water” Runoff Desalination “Desalination plant” Fish </p>,No,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],11/07/2022 16:06,"James, Jennifer",11/07/2022 16:06,"James, Jennifer",0,,,,,Jenny James
15302,11/07/2022,Jenny James,"<p>Changing economic conditions may mean that cheap services, once propped up by venture capitalist investment, will be a thing of the past.</p>","<p>This is a complex issue with the potential to impact Environment Agency operations and staff welfare by contributing to rising costs, as well as possibly changing urban landscapes by reducing the availability of low-cost services. This may encourage more people to use alternative services such as public transport, cycling or walking, alternatively it might lead to more people driving. Investment from venture capitalists, lured in by rapidly increasing customer numbers, have financially subsidised start-ups and tech companies such as Uber and Just Eat, believing that they were investing in the next Google or Amazon. Venture capitalism has propped up many start-ups, allowing them to charge prices that actually make a loss (but encourage more customers to join), now, thanks to rising interest rates and less-willing labour markets, these super-cheap prices are forced to increase. The concept has been dubbed the ‘millennial lifestyle subsidy’, having allowed (mainly millennials) a higher standard of living for very little financial cost. Due to falling markets, rising inflation and changing labour markets, investment in unprofitable companies is much less viable, meaning that they are no longer propped-up by investor funding. Loss of investment does mean that customers will have to pay a more realistic price for once-cheap services such as food delivery. It will also likely lead to low-income workers being paid more fairly for their work. </p>","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2022/06/uber-ride-share-prices-high-inflation/661250/"">https&%2358;//www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2022/06/uber-ride-share-prices-high-inflation/661250/</a></p>",<p>The End of the Millennial Lifestyle Subsidy</p>,The Atlantic,13/06/2022,Derek Thompson,"<p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.nytimes.com/2021/06/08/technology/farewell-millennial-lifestyle-subsidy.html"">https&%2358;//www.nytimes.com/2021/06/08/technology/farewell-millennial-lifestyle-subsidy.html</a></p>",economics1,business economics,,economics1,,1 - operational work,2 - near to realisation,2 - credible,<p>“Millennial lifestyle subsidy” Start-ups “Venture Capitalist” Investment Anti-competitive “Cost of living” “Predatory pricing” Profitability </p>,No,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],11/07/2022 16:00,"James, Jennifer",11/07/2022 16:00,"James, Jennifer",0,,,,,Jenny James
15301,11/07/2022,Jenny James,<p>Scientists have designed a tiny ‘robot-fish’ that adsorbs microplastics for sampling from water.</p>,"<p>The Environment Agency could use this technology for sampling microplastics from waterbodies for further analysis or fingerprinting (%2315228). Researchers at Sichuan University have designed a tiny self-propelled ‘robo-fish’ that can latch on to free-floating microplastics, and fix itself if it gets cut or damaged while on its expedition. The robo-fish is just 13mm long and uses a light laser system in its tail to propel itself forward at almost 30mm a second, similar to the speed at which plankton drift around in moving water. The researchers created a material similar to nacre (mother-of-pearl) by layering various microscopic sheets of molecules, emulating nacre’s specific chemical gradient. The material created is stretchy, flexible to twist, and even able to pull up to 5kg in weight, according to the study. The organic dyes, antibiotics, and heavy metals in the microplastics have strong chemical bonds and generate electrostatic interactions with the material meaning that they cling on to its surface. The fish can therefore collect and remove microplastics from the water. This is a proof of concept and is still in development for real world use. Adsorption of microplastics could be useful for collecting microplastic samples for analysis and potentially for removal of microplastics from contaminated waters. The team will soon be working on more functionally complex robo-fish that can go deeper under the water.</p>","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jun/22/scientists-unveil-bionic-robo-fish-to-remove-microplastics-from-seas"">https&%2358;//www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jun/22/scientists-unveil-bionic-robo-fish-to-remove-microplastics-from-seas</a></p>",<p>Scientists unveil bionic robo-fish to remove microplastics from seas</p>,The Guardian,22/06/2022,Sofia Quaglia,,pollution1,micropollutant,,water2,,1 - operational work,4 - signficant development needed,2 - credible,<p>Microplastic Pollution Sampling Adsorption Robot Material Nanotechnology</p>,No,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],11/07/2022 15:57,"James, Jennifer",11/07/2022 15:57,"James, Jennifer",0,,,,,Jenny James
15300,11/07/2022,Jenny James,<p>Researchers have developed a fast and economical method of converting methane into liquid methanol at ambient temperature and pressure.</p>,"<p>This technology could be of interest to businesses that the Environment Agency regulates including landfill sites and could help contribute to the UK’s net zero targets. Excess methane is commonly burned off, or flared, to reduce its environmental impact. However, this combustion process still produces carbon dioxide, which itself is a greenhouse gas. Industry has long sought an economical and efficient way to convert methane into methanol, a highly versatile feedstock used to make a variety of products including antifreeze, synthetic fabrics, adhesives, paint, plywood and chemical agents used in pharmaceuticals. Not only would this conversion help to reduce methane emissions, but it would also provide an economic incentive to do so. This new method takes place under continuous flow over a photo-catalytic material using visible light to drive the conversion. In the past high pressures and temperatures have been necessary to convert shale gas to methanol and other products (%2314129), a process which is energetically costly. The method occurs at ambient temperatures and pressures and involves a continuous flow of methane/oxygen-saturated water over a novel metal-organic framework (MOF) catalyst. The MOF is porous and contains different components that each have a role in absorbing light, transferring electrons, and activating and bringing together methane and oxygen. The process is selective and does not produce any unwanted by-products. </p>","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//scitechdaily.com/scientists-discover-holy-grail-of-catalysis-converting-methane-into-methanol-using-light/"">https&%2358;//scitechdaily.com/scientists-discover-holy-grail-of-catalysis-converting-methane-into-methanol-using-light/</a></p>",<p>Scientists Discover “Holy Grail of Catalysis” – Converting Methane Into Methanol Using Light</p>,Science Daily,30/06/2022,,,industry1,integrated pollution control,,pollution1,,1 - operational work,3 - some development needed,2 - credible,<p>Methane Emissions Technology “Chemical conversion” Methanol “Metal organic framework” “Greenhouse gas”</p>,No,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],11/07/2022 15:52,"James, Jennifer",11/07/2022 15:52,"James, Jennifer",0,,,,,Jenny James

EEG analysis of a specific brainwave, known as the P300, could be used to determine if a witness or a suspect recognises crucial pieces of information related to a crime. P300 is an electrical brainwave detectable via EEG electrodes as a positive or negative deflection &%23160;about 300 to 600 milliseconds after presentation with a meaningful stimulus. This reaction is considered a reliable index of memory recognition. A statistical calculation then determines if the stimulus—the face of an attacker or a weapon—is recognised. This method has been the subject of dozens of experiments across four independent laboratories spanning at least four countries, but more independent testing is needed to verify it’s reliability. </p><p>Researchers have also developed a new AI algorithm that predicts future crime and claims 90% accuracy within 1000ft of crime. The algorithm uses publicly available urban crime data to train the model, which forecasts homicide and burglary crimes using city specific ‘spatio-temporal dependencies’ from event reports. The new tool was tested and validated using historical data on violent crimes and property crimes. These data were used because they were most likely to be reported to police in urban areas where there is historical distrust and lack of cooperation with law enforcement. Such crimes are also less prone to enforcement bias, as is the case with drug crimes, traffic stops, and other misdemeanour infractions. There are still concerns that the data used to train the algorithm could contain systemic biases, mirroring police enforcement’s complex relationship with crime and society. A separate model showed crime in wealthier areas resulted in more arrests, while crime in poor neighbourhoods didn’t, suggesting bias in police response and enforcement.</p>","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//techxplore.com/news/2022-07-brainwaves-criminal-trials.html"">https&%2358;//techxplore.com/news/2022-07-brainwaves-criminal-trials.html</a></p>",<p>How your brainwaves could be used in criminal trials</p>,Tech Explore,01/07/2022,Michel Funicelli,"<p><a href=""https&%2358;//scitechdaily.com/ai-algorithm-predicts-future-crimes-one-week-in-advance-with-90-accuracy/"">https&%2358;//scitechdaily.com/ai-algorithm-predicts-future-crimes-one-week-in-advance-with-90-accuracy/</a></p><p>https&%2358;//www.nature.com/articles/s41562-022-01372-0</p>",legislation,crime,prosecution,legislation,,1 - operational work,3 - some development needed,2 - credible,<p>AI “Artificial intelligence” Technolegal “Crime prediction” Enforcement Crime Law Technology “Brain waves” Polygraph Algorithm P300 &%23160;&%23160;</p>,No,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],11/07/2022 15:45,"James, Jennifer",11/07/2022 15:45,"James, Jennifer",0,,,,,Jenny James

15297,28/06/2022,Jason Dinsdale,"<p>Developments are making nuclear power more portable, with the potential to be used in more diverse environments and at a smaller scale.</p>","<p>The Environment Agency as a regulator of the nuclear industry may need to consider how these developments could impact on current regulatory enforcement and monitoring of both operators and waste. Portable nuclear devices may also have a role in infrastructure provision during major incidents. There have been previous examples of portable nuclear generators, though these have tended to be floating and still quite sizeable (%2315263). The US Department of Defence recently contracted out for development of a fourth generation portable nuclear reactor which could fit inside a standard container, making it readily transportable by land, sea and air. The system, developed by a consortium headed by BWXT Technologies Inc, is expected to generate between &%23160;1-5 MWe and will use TRISO fuel, high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) fuel that can withstand extreme heat and has low environmental risks. Development and testing is suspected to last for several years before wider deployment as part of the Department’s goal of achieving Net Zero by 2050. The system may also find applications in disaster responses, providing power to remote locations. A private company is taking a fresh look at the quest for nuclear fusion power through developing a backpack sized reactor. Current projects to harness the power of nuclear fusion are large scale, resource intensive and so far use more energy than they generate. Avalanche Energy’s orbitron fusion battery is taking a different approach, using a small scale design and principles of rapid prototyping to overcome the limitations that large scale projects bring. Rather than relying on magnets to heat and squeeze hydrogen plasma. The orbitron will generate two jets of hydrogen plasma, a process already well understood. When the jets collide they should realise enough kinetic energy for fusion to occur. Through small scale rapid prototyping, including using additive manufacturing and 3D printing, Avalanche Energy believe that they can ‘catch up’ to the level of larger projects such as tokamak (%2313297) and have a small unit producing 5 kW of power, enough to power a home, in a matter of years. Their modular design could mean that orbitron use could be scaled up to meet larger demand such as cities. While nuclear fusion is still a challenging goal even on a small scale, realisation could lead to a significant decarbonisation of energy demand, but lead to a proliferation of decentralised small scale devices requiring regulation under a completely different regime to existing installations.</p>",<p>https&%2358;//medium.com/predict/the-fusion-reactor-you-can-carry-in-a-backpack-995ccc02dc0d</p>,<p>The fusion reactor you can carry in a backpack</p>,Medium,10/05/2022,"Lockett, W","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//interestingengineering.com/us-army-portable-nuclear-reactor-2024"">The US Army will have a portable nuclear reactor ready by 2024 (interestingengineering.com)</a></p>",energy,nuclear energy,,energy,,1 - operational work,3 - some development needed,3 - less credible,<p>energy regulation nuclear fission fusion &quot;US Department of Defence&quot; contract container portable mobile generator fuel&%23160;BWXT Technologies Inc&%23160;TRISO&%23160;high-assay low-enriched uranium HALEU &quot;Net Zero&quot; climate disaster incident management&%23160; &quot;Avalanche Energy&quot; orbitron hydrogen plasma tokomak rapid prototyping &quot;3D printing&quot; &quot;additive manufacturing&quot; rare metal element decarbonisation urban decentralisation modular waste recycling</p>,No,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],28/06/2022 09:15,"Dinsdale, Jason",28/06/2022 09:15,"Dinsdale, Jason",0,,,,,Jason Dinsdale

15295,27/06/2022,Jason Dinsdale,<p>Increasingly sophisticated citizen science is being employed in environmental monitoring that is challenging environmental legislation and regulation activities.</p>,"<p>The Environment Agency and partners may need to establish new working relationships with activist science, which may bring complementary benefits, or may wish to risk creating divergent narratives on the state of the environment and expose itself to criticism and legal action. A group of citizen scientists based in Bristol, UK recently ran a project for the local council looking into the potential toxicity of wood burning stoves in urban areas. The group targeted the Ashley area of the city with a high concentration of domestic wood burning stoves, where their network of air quality sensors recorded 11 breaches of World Health Organization daily guidelines for ultra-fine particulate pollution (PM 2.5) over a period of six months.The council hopes the project will raise awareness of the health impact of wood smoke on public health and lead to greater use of gas and electric heating, which is overall less impactful on urban air quality. However, rising energy costs are making wood burning a more economically attractive option. Wood burners and open fires are thought to cause 17 per cent of the UK’s PM 2.5 pollution – more than the pollution caused by road traffic. A proposed new government target for small particulates of 10 micrograms per cubic metre for England by 2040 is close to existing levels in cities such as Bristol and double safe concentrations set by the WHO. In the USA residents of Belmont County, Ohio recently challenged the accuracy of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)’s air quality sensors with their own rival network. The health of residents had long suffered from a range of symptoms, including headaches, fatigue, nausea and burning sensations in their throats and noses, which was attributed to local fracking activities. However the EPA dismissed their concerns based on its own monitoring data. With assistance from Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, MIT and the American Geophysical Union’s Thriving Earth Exchange, local activists ran an alternative 60 node low-cost sensor network, monitoring for particulate matter and volatile organic compounds, which verified that the EPA’s sensors were not accurate, therefore distorting the true level of air pollution. The sensors showed that many areas were experiencing air pollution levels exceeding WHO recommendations. The data have allowed community leaders to submit targeted public records requests about these operations and their compliance with air quality standards. The project has generated an academic paper, but more relevantly demonstrates the ability of community activism and citizen science to challenge both operator and regulator, especially aided by academia. By embracing activities similar to this it may be possible for the Environment Agency to increase the granularity of its own monitoring programmes and build trust with communities, however it must also be mindful of the need to respond to challenge swiftly and constructively to avoid damaging the potential benefits offered by increasingly sophisticated citizen science.</p>",<p>https&%2358;//news.climate.columbia.edu/2022/05/25/community-led-science-uncovers-high-air-pollution-from-fracking-in-ohio-county/</p>,<p>Community-led science uncovers high air pollution from fracking in Ohio County</p>,Columbia Climate School,25/05/2022,"Fecht, S","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac6ad6"">Community-based participatory research for low-cost air pollution monitoring in the wake of unconventional oil and gas development in the Ohio River Valley&%2358; Empowering impacted residents through community science - IOPscience</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/29/do-wood-burners-add-to-air-pollution-in-cities-yes-say-citizen-scientists"">Do wood burners add to air pollution in cities?

15294,27/06/2022,Jason Dinsdale,<p>Magnesium and sodium are gaining ground as potential substitutes for lithium in battery production.&%23160;</p>,"<p>The Environment Agency should be interested in these developments from a waste management and circular economy perspective. Lithium is widely used in batteries but it is a relatively rare element on Earth, and tends not to be recycled. Research is commencing to look into the possibility of replacing lithium in batteries with a magnesium based alternative. Magnesium is more plentiful and can perform at a similar level to lithium under the right conditions. The environmental impact of rare earth element extraction is well documented. Much of the World’s magnesium supply comes from China in a fossil fuel intensive process. As the price of magnesium has risen recently the economics of exploiting other sources start to look more favourable. One such proposed scheme in northern Australia is looking to use on-site solar generated electricity and hydrogen extracted from plentiful water sources to produce ‘green’ magnesium ready for domestic use and export. Battery technology based on sodium is also emerging as a viable alternative to lithium, again driven by rising global commodity prices. Sodium-ion (Na-ion) batteries offer some advantages to lithium. It is one thousand times more abundant with cheaper extraction costs. This makes them potentially cheaper than lithium based batteries, but only if they are produced at scale. However, many manufacturers are investing in Na-ion manufacturing, and sodium could complement lithium as the dominant battery technology, including in electric vehicle (EV) use, using both systems to balance component availability against energy density. The Environment Agency may need to consider if waste regulations are adaptable to cover a range of element recovery in battery recycling as alternatives to lithium come onto the market at scale.</p>",<p>https&%2358;//www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/magnesium-in-batteries-sustainable-alternative-lithium/22063/</p>,<p>Magnesium in batteries&%2358; a sustainable alternative to lithium</p>,Innovation News Network,01/06/2022,,"<p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/korab-resources-creating-secure-supply-green-magnesium/18998/"">Korab Resources&%2358; Creating a secure supply of ‘green’ magnesium (innovationnewsnetwork.com)</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.pv-magazine.com/2022/03/26/the-weekend-read-sodium-ion-batteries-go-mainstream/"">The weekend read&%2358; Sodium-ion batteries go mainstream – pv magazine International (pv-magazine.com)</a></p>",waste,metal waste,,energy,,1 - operational work,3 - some development needed,2 - credible,<p>waste energy metal battery lithium magnesium sodium Na-ion Australia extraction export recycling sodium-ion China energy density</p>,No,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],27/06/2022 12:53,"Dinsdale, Jason",27/06/2022 12:53,"Dinsdale, Jason",0,,,,,Jason Dinsdale
15293,24/06/2022,Jason Dinsdale,<p>Recent innovations suggest that the components of electronic devices could be manufactured from regenerative organic materials rather than rare earth elements.</p>,"<p>These innovations should be of interest to the Environment Agency’s waste management activities, where recycling and disposal of waste electronics equipment (WEEE) can be problematic. Cellulose, a constituent of wood, is known to be able to carry an electric current when heated under certain conditions. It has previously been possible to create ‘nanopaper’ circuits through submitting the nanopaper to carbonisation, ‘burning’ a circuit onto it. However the same process can easily destroy the three dimensional nanostructures, preventing useful deployment. Researchers have now overcome this issue with a new treatment process. Firstly an iodine treatment protects the nanostructure of the nanopaper. Secondly a spatially controlled drying process prevents the carbonisation pyrolysis from further damage and the paper to be ‘tuned’ for specific purposes. Proof of concepts created a sensor to monitor water vapour passing through a face mask and a semiconductor in a biofuel cell that significantly outperformed a conventional graphite equivalent. &%23160;In separate research scientists have been able to create a semiconductor manufactured from honey. &%23160;Neuromorphic systems are being developed that promise faster computing through mimicking the structure of the human brain. Key to this development are components called memristors, similar to transistors but with the added ability to store memory. Scientists have been able to construct a memristor from honey sandwiched between two electrodes, emulating a human synapse. Proteins and sugars from Aloe vera leaves have also been trialled but honey shows the greatest potential as it can tolerate higher temperatures.Using honey in memristors would also contribute to reducing electronic waste, being easily dissolved in water come disposal and heralding renewable and biodegradable neuromorphic systems and further driving sustainable electronics made entirely from natural, regenerative materials.</p>",<p>https&%2358;//news.wsu.edu/press-release/2022/04/05/honey-holds-potential-for-making-brain-like-computer-chips/</p>,<p>Honey holds potential for making brain-like computer chips</p>,Washington State University,05/04/2022,"Zaske, S","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//interestingengineering.com/semiconductors-made-of-wood"">A new breakthrough brings semiconductors made of wood closer to reality (interestingengineering.com)</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsnano.1c10728"">Nanocellulose Paper Semiconductor with a 3D Network Structure and Its Nano–Micro–Macro Trans-Scale Design | ACS Nano</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6463/ac585b"">Memristive synaptic device based on a natural organic material—honey for spiking neural network in biodegradable neuromorphic systems - IOPscience</a></p>",economics1,industrial manufacturing,,waste,,1 - operational work,4 - signficant development needed,1 - Highly credible,<p>waste electronics WEEE regulation natural organic regenerative wood cellulose carbonisation pyrolysis circuit iodine&%23160;</p>,No,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],24/06/2022 10:08,"Dinsdale, Jason",24/06/2022 10:08,"Dinsdale, Jason",0,,,,,Jason Dinsdale

Weight and size based biases inevitably lead to issues with wellbeing, career progression and inclusion. This is relevant to Environment Agency as no organisation is free from the widespread negative stereotypes associated with fatness. Victims of sizeism encounter poor attitudes from colleagues, fewer opportunities to progress and a lack of personal protective equipment for larger body types or sizes. Lack of diverse role models discourages larger people and can make them feel unwelcome and not taken seriously at a professional level. Prejudices against their looks and size can hinder people’s career progression. Organisational culture changes are needed along with and focus on practical adjustments such as availability of larger size PPE, appropriate laboratory furniture, or ergonomic office chairs without arm rests.

For construction work the challenges are complying with building standards, developing new industrial processes for producing the materials, and developing an acceptable level of durability. However, the deeper challenges arise from customer acceptance and willingness to embrace something different for environmental reasons. These challenges are mainly psychological with perceptions and fears of mold, dry rot and spores everywhere in the lived environment.

15288,23/06/2022,Jenny James,<p>Researchers have developed fluorine-based nanostructures that successfully filter salt from water. </p>,"<p>Development of alternative drinking water sources are important for the Environment Agency as a way to ease water shortages, reduce pressure on water abstraction and from a water regulatory perspective. The team created test filtration membranes by chemically synthesizing nanoscopic fluorine rings, which were stacked and embedded in an otherwise impermeable lipid layer. As fluorine is electrically negative, it repels negative ions such as the chlorine found in salt. An added bonus of this negativity is that it breaks down ‘water clusters’, essentially loosely bound groups of water molecules, so that they pass through the channels quicker. Test samples were created with nanorings between 1 and 2nm. To test the effectiveness of their membranes the team measured the presence of chlorine ions, on either side of the test membrane. “The smaller of our test channels perfectly rejected incoming salt molecules, and the larger channels were still an improvement over other desalination techniques and even cutting-edge carbon nanotube filters. Our sample worked around 2,400 times faster than experimental carbon nanotube-based desalination devices.” At present, the synthesis of these materials is relatively energy-intensive but given the longevity of the membranes and their low operational costs, overall energy costs will be much lower than with current methods. Compared to current desalination methods, these fluorous nanochannels work faster, require less pressure and less energy, and are a more effective filter. Current methods of desalination are energetically costly and this innovation is a step toward low energy filtration of saltwater. If successful this technology could help to ease water shortages and reduce abstraction from water courses in the UK. </p>",<p>https&%2358;//www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/952019</p>,<p>The future of desalination?</p>,EurekAlert!,12/05/2022,Joseph Krisher,,water1,desalination,water desalination,water1,,1 - operational work,4 - signficant development needed,2 - credible,<p>Desalination “Drinking water” “Fresh water” Filtration “Water filtration” “Salt removal” Nanochannels “Flourous nanochannels”</p>,No,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],23/06/2022 10:11,"James, Jennifer",23/06/2022 10:11,"James, Jennifer",0,,,,,Jenny James
15287,23/06/2022,Jenny James,<p>Researchers have developed a low CO2 method for producing hydrogen from bananas using flash light irrigation. </p>,"<p>The Environment Agency should be aware of this potential alternative source of green hydrogen as the UK scales up a ‘hydrogen economy’ in line with the Hydrogen Strategy (2021). Banana waste is common because as they ripen brown spots appear on the skin, often leading to supermarkets disposing of them as unsellable. Now, this waste could have an alternative use. Researchers have developed ‘photo-pyrolysis’ to produce hydrogen from banana peel and were able to capture all of the waste products. Pyrolysis decomposes the biomass at temperatures of 400 to 800°C, in containers without oxygen, but requires specific reactors that can handle high temperatures and pressures. Photo-pyrolysis using a xenon lamp emits a bright white light and one powerful flashlight shot can trigger biomass conversion in just a few milliseconds. First, the banana peels must be dried at around 100°C for 24 hours, then ground and sieved to a fine powder with each kilogram of dried biomass can creating around 100 litres of hydrogen and 330g of biochar. A major concern with biomass conversion is that it can actually release more CO2, for example where forests are logged, to fuel power stations. But the team of Swiss-based scientists explain that all the products from their photo-thermal technique can be captured, making it economical and climate-safe.</p>","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.euronews.com/green/2022/02/01/blasting-bananas-with-light-could-pave-the-way-for-more-eco-friendly-biomass"">https&%2358;//www.euronews.com/green/2022/02/01/blasting-bananas-with-light-could-pave-the-way-for-more-eco-friendly-biomass</a></p>",<p>Blasting bananas with light could pave the way for more ‘eco-friendly’ biomass | Euronews </p>,Euronews,07/06/2022,Lottie Limb,<p>https&%2358;//pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2022/SC/D1SC06322G</p><p>https&%2358;//www.openaccessgovernment.org/browning-banana-food-waste-household/135392/</p>,energy,pyrolysis,,energy,,4 - possible future remit,4 - signficant development needed,2 - credible,<p>Hydrogen Biomass Photo-pyrolysis ‘Green hydrogen’ ‘Food waste’ Biochar ‘Hydrogen Strategy’ Pyrolysis</p>,No,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],23/06/2022 09:57,"James, Jennifer",23/06/2022 09:57,"James, Jennifer",0,,,,,Jenny James

15284,14/06/2022,Jason Dinsdale,<p>Emissions from an increasing number of rocket launches may be having unforeseen impacts on the Earth’s atmosphere.</p>,"<p>The Environment Agency is already involved in regulating space launch and should therefore be interested in potentially far reaching impacts from this activity. Concerns have been expressed previously about the impact of emissions created from space debris burning up in the atmosphere (%23****). Compared to sectors such as aviation, the volume of emissions from space flight is currently extremely small. However the number of space launches is increasing, with a new record of 133 flights per year set in 2022. What is also of concern is that the emissions from rocket exhausts are being deposited in layers of the atmosphere in relatively high concentrations. A single rocket launch produces significantly more carbon dioxide than a single commercial airliner flight, as well as alumina and black carbon particles, which can scatter sunlight and impact temperature and circulation in the stratosphere. Recent research has focussed on the substances emitted during launch. Researchers modelled exhaust emissions from SpaceX’s Falcon Nine rocket against changing conditions as it moved up through the atmosphere above the Earth. They found that while the overall amount of emissions is relatively small compared to the surrounding atmosphere, the amount of CO2 is highly significant at higher levels of the atmosphere. The model suggests that once the Falcon Nine reaches 43.5 miles (70 km), it releases more than 25 times the amount of CO2 found in a cubic kilometre of air at that altitude. Carbon monoxide (CO) and water are also being released in similarly high relative concentrations. It is not known as to the fate and impact of these emissions, but water is known to immediately freeze, and carbon monoxide reacts with hydroxide (O2) to form more CO2. Thermal nitrogen oxides (NOx) were also discovered to persist in hot rivers before dispersing throughout the atmosphere, especially at lower altitudes. New research due to be published later this year will link rocket launches to ozone depletion. And elsewhere it is suggested that pollution may be contributing to increasingly frequent noctilucent cloud formations at an altitude of about 80km, which is virtually the edge of space. With launch numbers still relatively low, some think that atmospheric impacts are relatively low. However the conclusions of this research challenges that assumption. More research may be required to establish what the impacts are, but increasing numbers of space launches may exacerbate any issues discovered. The Environment Agency and partners may therefore need to consider regulatory regimes which can adequately accommodate space and high atmosphere activities.</p>",<p>https&%2358;//interestingengineering.com/physicists-spacex-falcon-9-atmosphere</p>,<p>Physicists figured out how launching a Falcon 9 changes the atmosphere</p>,Interesting Engineering,17/05/2022,"Currin, G","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/5.0090017?journalCode=phf"">Atmospheric pollution from rockets&%2358; Physics of Fluids&%2358; Vol 34, No 5 (scitation.org)</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jun/06/is-human-pollution-causing-clouds-to-form-near-the-edge-of-space"">Is human pollution causing clouds to form near the edge of space? | Pollution | The Guardian</a></p>",air,air pollution,,transport,,1 - operational work,1 - realised,1 - Highly credible,<p>regulation space rocket emission pollution pollutant SpaceX atmosphere model &quot;carbon dioxide&quot; CO2 &quot;carbon monoxide&quot; CO water &quot;nitrogen oxide&quot; NOx &quot;black carbon&quot; alumina aluminium &quot;space debris&quot; climate ice atmosphere stratosphere &quot;Falcon Nine&quot; launch</p>,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],14/06/2022 13:52,"Dinsdale, Jason",14/06/2022 13:46,"Dinsdale, Jason",0,,,,,Jason Dinsdale

15279,10/06/2022,Jason Dinsdale,<p>A recent review of academic literature suggests that the last 20 years of ecotoxicology research has focussed on a relatively limited number of substances.</p>,"<p>This could be indicative of significant gaps in ecotoxicological knowledge and by consequence, &%23160;regulatory regimes which are effective at preventing exposure to safe environmental limits. Researchers examined over 98,000 papers published over the last two decades, representing research on over 18,000 chemicals. They found that the 65 most frequently named chemicals accounted for 50 per cent of references, and that the top 11 chemicals accounted for 25 per cent of references. Metals including cadmium, copper, mercury and arsenic were often mentioned, as were the female hormone, estradiol and the herbicide atrazine. Over the study period it was found that the prominence of &%23160;pharmaceuticals had increased, whereas plant protection products had decreased. Some chemicals also occurred more frequently in corporate publications compared to academic ones. Of the 253 chemicals occurring in at least 100 papers, some that were absent in 2000 became commonplace by 2019, such as the anti-inflammatory diclofenac. Chemicals that were widely banned during this period were observed to decrease in frequency, such as atrazine. While there are caveats to acknowledge on limitations to study and data inaccuracies the research suggests that there may be significant ecotoxicological knowledge gaps due to a high over-representation of a small number of substances and little or no information on many chemicals with the potential to be hazardous. The researchers suggest that more needs to be done to reconsider and reprioritise research funding to fill the knowledge gaps needed for effective regulation of potential pollutants. The Environment Agency and partners may need to reflect on this analysis to influence their own research programmes and regulatory remits to help fill these evidence gaps.</p>",<p>https&%2358;//ec.europa.eu/environment/integration/research/newsalert/pdf/578na3_en-1372-does-the-scientific-knowledge-reflect-the-chemical-diversity-of-environmental-pollution.pdf</p>,<p>Twenty years of ecotoxicology studies&%2358; review finds focus is on a&%23160;narrow range of potentially hazardous substances</p>,Science For Environmental Policy,21/04/2022,,"<p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901121002537?via%3Dihub"">Does the scientific knowledge reflect the chemical diversity of environmental pollution? – A twenty-year perspective - ScienceDirect</a></p>",chemistry1,ecotoxicity,,research,,1 - operational work,1 - realised,1 - Highly credible,<p>chemistry chemical ecotoxicology research regulation pollution pollutant substance&%23160;cadmium copper mercury metal arsenic&%23160;herbicide atrazine female hormone estradiol &quot;plant protection product&quot;&%23160;anti-inflammatory diclofenac pharmaceutical &quot;carboxylic acid&quot; plastic</p>,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],10/06/2022 16:20,"Dinsdale, Jason",10/06/2022 16:20,"Dinsdale, Jason",0,,,,,Jason Dinsdale
15278,10/06/2022,Jason Dinsdale,"<p>As inequality and the environmental emergency rise up the agenda, there are signs that even the ultra-rich are demanding systematic change.</p>","<p>This is of interest to the Environment Agency and partners of signs of social change which may aid the environmental agenda, as well as potentially generate more funds for environmental work through both taxation and donation. A group of millionaires have joined forces at the recent World Economic Forum meeting in Davos to demand that World leaders tackle the cost of living crisis by increasing taxes for the ultra-rich. The group called Patriotic Millionaires is concerned that recent global events including the coronavirus pandemic have led to an increase in wealth accumulation amongst the wealthiest people. Signatories of the letter that went to Davos include Abigail Disney, heir to the Disney empire. Disney is also cited as one of a growing number of millionaires who have inherited great wealth and are now giving their money away to charitable causes and social enterprises. Some of this seems motivated by a desire to ‘do good’ and alleviate current issues such as climate change and inequality, but there are also steps to make amends for past exploitation on which the fortune had been built, such as slavery. Organisations such as Resource Generation in the USA and UK based Resource Justice bring together communities of the richest 18- to 35-year-olds “committed to the equitable distribution of wealth, land, and power.” Both have seen rapid growth in recent years. This could be seen as reflecting generational values of what has been dubbed The Great Wealth transfer, as over the next decade the generational cohort known as Millennials (born approximately 1981 - 1996) are set to inherit £327bn from their parents. However, wealth may not be the barrier to taking action, as it was recently reported that an oil company consultant recently made headlines for quitting the business on grounds of “failing on a massive planetary scale” to limit climate risks. These stories suggest that assumed socioeconomic driving forces may be changing, particularly amongst demographic cohorts which will have increasingly more political and economic influence over the coming years. This has implications for the socioeconomic and political operating space for the Environment Agency, presenting opportunities to increase political and economic support for its work.</p>",<p>https&%2358;//www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/22/millionaires-join-davos-protests-demanding-tax-us-now-taxation-wealthy-cost-of-living-crisis</p>,"<p>Millionaires join Davos protests, demanding ‘tax us now’</p>",The Guardian,22/05/2022,"Neate, R","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/22/millionaires-join-davos-protests-demanding-tax-us-now-taxation-wealthy-cost-of-living-crisis"">Millionaires join Davos protests, demanding ‘tax us now’ | Davos 2022 | The Guardian</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-61549155"">Millionaires at Davos say 'tax us more' - BBC News</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.politico.eu/article/shell-consultant-caroline-dennett-quits-extreme-harm-planet-climate-change-fossil-fuels-extraction/"">Shell consultant quits, says company causes ‘extreme harm’ to planet – POLITICO</a></p><p>https&%2358;//blabbermouth.net/news/metallica-donates-over-135000-to-flood-disaster-victims-in-germany</p><p>&%23160;</p><p>&%23160;</p>",economics1,taxation policy,,"social aspects, population",,4 - possible future remit,2 - near to realisation,3 - less credible,<p>economics wealth tax finance Davos millionaire rich Millennial &quot;Great Wealth Transfer&quot; Disney &quot;climate change&quot; funding inequality slavery industry business demographic</p>,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],25/07/2022 14:13,"Tang, Liisa",10/06/2022 14:13,"Dinsdale, Jason",0,,,,,Jason Dinsdale

Direct air capture (DAC) is the processes of removing carbon dioxide directly from the air. The system works like a liquid direct air capture, where the gas is bubbled through a liquid solution. However, instead of getting trapped in the solution, the chemical reaction occurs so that the trapped carbon is insoluble and comes out of the solution as a solid. The captured carbon can either be stored in deep geological formations or used in various human activities such as food processing or making synthetic fuels. Using liquid amine compounds, including isophorone diamine, the research group achieved &gt;99% CO2 removal efficiency under a 400 ppm CO2 (approximately the same as atmospheric concentrations) flow system. The trapped carbon precipitated out as carbamic acid, and the rate of this reaction is twice as fast as that of leading DAC systems around the world. Trapped carbon is released by heating the precipitate up to 60 degrees Celsius and the recovered liquid can be reused. The major drawback of carbon capture systems is their lack of efficiency. Although large-scale systems are currently being built or put into place to trap carbon, the systems lose efficiency as they trap carbon and are marred by high costs of recovery of the gas.</p>",<p>https&%2358;//interestingengineering.com/direct-carbon-capture-99-percent-efficient</p>,<p>The Japanese carbon capture method is 99 percent efficient and twice as fast</p>,Interesting Engineering,30/05/2022,Ameya Paleja,"<p><u><a href=""https&%2358;//pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsenvironau.1c00065"">https&%2358;//pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsenvironau.1c00065</a></u></p>",climate,climate change mitigation,,pollution1,,1 - operational work,3 - some development needed,1 - Highly credible,<p>“Carbon capture” “Direct air capture” Carbon “Carbon dioxide” Carbon capture and storage” “Carbon removal” “Greenhouse gas” “Net zero”</p>,No,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],06/06/2022 09:19,"James, Jennifer",06/06/2022 09:19,"James, Jennifer",0,,,,,Jenny James

Some are concerned that geoengineering if not properly managed could accidentally change global climate patterns, or that individuals may have the power to instigate global change through geoengineering without consent. Commonly discussed geoengineering methods involve seeding the atmosphere with sulphur particles to reflect sunlight, or spreading iron in the ocean to absorb carbon dioxide. There are concerns that either could be potentially dangerous, changing rain patterns and causing crops to fail. While the science behind geoengineering is sound, any actual deployment would need careful global cooperation, the mechanisms of which Lamy points out are currently non-existent.

The robotic vehicles will send information about the state of construction back to the AI system, eliminating human error such as delivering to the wrong part of the site.

15271,01/06/2022,Jason Dinsdale,<p>Mitigating climate change through tree planting could be more effective with species optimised for carbon capture.</p>,"<p>The Environment Agency and partners should be considering the most effective tree planting solutions in the face of concerns around biodiversity and climate change itself, which will affect species suitability for carbon sequestering. Researchers are currently looking at ways to make plant photosynthesis more efficient as a way to capture more carbon through tree growth. Photosynthesis as a process is extremely inefficient. However experiments involving genetically altered tobacco plants suggest that it may be possible to increase this efficiency, which would translate into greater growth and therefore more rapid carbon capture compared to non-modified trees. A Californian startup called Living Carbon has already taken steps in this direction through experimenting with genetically modified poplar trees that can grow up to 53 per cent quicker than non-edited trees. Further research is needed to determine if the increased growth occurs throughout the trees’ entire life cycle. Others believe that it may be possible to improve tree carbon capture potential through natural cross-breeding, which may in turn prove to be more resilient to changing climates and habitats. The debate between genetic modification and selective breeding of trees for carbon capture purposes in some ways mirrors similar debates in agricultural circles. But with development and tree growth taking place over decades rather than years and the pressing need for climate action it is unclear currently which direction it may take. The overall impacts on biodiversity and conservation may also need factoring. There may be regulatory implications and environmental concerns for the Environment Agency and partners should either approach gain traction and approach to realisation.<br>&%23160;</p>",<p>https&%2358;//www.wired.co.uk/article/trees-carbon-capture-genes</p>,<p>A bold idea to stall the climate crisis - by building better trees</p>,Wired,28/03/2022,"Reynolds., M","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.16.480797v2.full"">Enhanced photosynthetic efficiency for increased carbon assimilation and woody biomass production in hybrid poplar INRA 717-1B4 | bioRxiv</a></p>",forestry,tree,,climate,,2 - advisory work,4 - signficant development needed,2 - credible,<p>woodland tree &quot;climate change&quot; carbon capture genetic modification selection breeding species habitat environment poplar photosynthesis gene &quot;Living Carbon&quot; tobacco regulation</p>,No,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],01/06/2022 12:36,"Dinsdale, Jason",01/06/2022 12:36,"Dinsdale, Jason",0,,,,,Jason Dinsdale

15268,30/05/2022,Jenny James,<p>The countryside charity CPRE has found significant reduction in people experiencing severe light pollution levels. </p>,"<p>Reduced light pollution and the associated impacts on health, energy use and wildlife should be of interest to the Environment Agency from net zero, biodiversity and staff welfare perspective. A survey by the countryside charity CPRE has suggested that light pollution has decreased as a result of fears over soaring energy costs and increased home working. Like all forms of pollution, light pollution is damaging our mental and physical health, and also having a severe impact on wildlife, especially insects. On top of this the energetic cost of street and office lighting is a hindrance to the UK’s net zero targets. Light pollution sharply dropped during the pandemic lockdowns and the levels continue to fall despite restrictions having been lifted. Light pollution levels are now at the lowest they have been since 2011. The increased cost of energy has led to households reducing energy waste by turning off the lights. Furthermore, local councils have followed suit, reducing street lighting to limit costs. This coupled with a rise in home working reducing the need to light and heat office buildings has encouraged the reduction in lighting. This is good news for reducing carbon emissions and prove that small adaptations can have a significant effect. Reduced light pollution is also beneficial for wildlife, particularly nocturnal insects. The impact of light pollution on insects is well known and has contributed to their declining numbers. A recent survey by Buglife suggests that flying insect numbers have reduced 65% since 2004. Insects are essential for ecosystem functioning and are economically important for agriculture. Reduced light pollution could offer some mitigation to these declines.</p>",<p>https&%2358;//www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/17/light-pollution-falling-amid-soaring-energy-prices-star-survey</p>,"<p>Light pollution falling amid soaring energy prices, star survey finds</p>",The Guardian,17/05/2022,Helena Horton,"<p><u><a href=""https&%2358;//www.buglife.org.uk/get-involved/surveys/bugs-matter/"">https&%2358;//www.buglife.org.uk/get-involved/surveys/bugs-matter/</a></u></p><p>https&%2358;//www.euronews.com/green/2022/05/14/insect-decline-could-massively-increase-food-bills-warn-scientists</p>",environmental policy2,wildlife conservation,,pollution1,,2 - advisory work,2 - near to realisation,2 - credible,<p>“Light pollution” “Reduced emissions” “Carbon emissions” “Energy cost” “Energy use” “Net zero” Welfare Biodiversity Wildlife Insects</p>,No,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],30/05/2022 16:06,"James, Jennifer",30/05/2022 16:06,"James, Jennifer",0,,,,,Jenny James

The existence of obesogens – chemicals that affect people’s hormones and lead to a build-up of fat in the body - has been debated by scientists for several years (%2314396). Recent publications confirm that plastics contain a potent mixture of chemicals that promote adipogenesis, a key process in the development of obesity. The pollutants can also directly affect the number and size of fat cells, alter the signals that make people feel full, change thyroid function and the dopamine reward system. Finally, these pollutants can affect the microbiome in the gut and cause weight gain by making the uptake of calories from the intestines more efficient. The review identifies about 50 chemicals as having good evidence of obesogenic effects. Pollutants cited by the researchers as increasing obesity include bisphenol A (BPA), which is widely added to plastics, as well as some pesticides, flame retardants and air pollution. Past research has linked various types of bisphenol with endocrine disruption and chromosomal abnormalities (%2314698, %2314305, %2314277, %2313012). Researchers are especially concerned because these pollutants are widely used&%2358; in water and dust, food packaging, personal hygiene products and household cleaners, furniture and electronics.

It is believed that the attack was intended primarily to disrupt Ukrainian communications, hampering its efforts against Russian invasion. However the service’s customers extend beyond just Ukraine&%2358; thousands of users across other European countries also experienced a loss of service, which continued for at least a month. In Germany 2000 wind turbines were still offline, and the attack has rendered many users’ modems “unusable”. Intelligence agencies are investigating the attack. What has become apparent however is the ‘spillover’ effect of the attack, where impacts were felt beyond the intended target (assumed to be Ukraine), with services affected in Germany, UK, Czech Republic and as far away as Morocco. This demonstrates that the impacts of conflict related cyber attack can be felt beyond nations directly involved in that conflict. At the 2018 launch of UK Government’s defence space strategy, ‘jamming’ of satellites was recognised as a potential threat (%2314739). As satellites increasingly show potential in diverse uses such as blockchain provision (%2314969) and of particular note, environmental monitoring (%2314834), risks to service provision may increase in step.

The idea of “emissive energy harvesters” for thermoradiative power generation was introduced in 2014 but only now have researchers been able to obtain a measurable outcome. Although the power efficiency measured was only 1.8 %, this, when developed further, could prove to become a valuable technology for industry needs.

This is relevant to Environment Agency because sand extracted from quarries, rivers and other locations is the most exploited natural resource, yet even Environment Agency needs it for their own construction work including flood defences. The extraction of sand at large quantities evidently leads to environmental impacts such as erosion, loss of habitats and carbon emissions originated from the sand production process. Instead of ending up as mining waste, the so-called ore-sand can be repurposed and therefore this finding has potential to reduce sand extraction and support the trend towards circular economy, by providing a more sustainable option for substituting sand as construction material and for industrial use. The researchers estimate that potentially half of sand markets globally can locate a local source for gaining ore-sand, hence reduce carbon emissions from lorries.

It is already known to Environment Agency that seagrass meadows perform as one of the most efficient carbon dioxide sinks, removing twice as much as woodlands but 35 times faster. The new finding is significant because the amount of sugar released is at least 80 times more than previously thought for the marine environments, with an estimate of more than one million tons of sucrose worldwide, indicating significant consequences for carbon burial. Due to seagrasses excreting phenolic compounds that prevent most microorganisms from degrading the sucrose, the sucrose remains buried under the seagrass meadows.

15254,18/05/2022,Jenny James,<p>Methane reducing seaweed diet supplement for Ben&amp; Jerry’s dairy cows.</p>,"<p>This is an interesting development for the Environment Agency as a regulator of agriculture as well as for the potential future growth commercial seaweed production industry which will need to be regulated. In the US seaweed is grown inland in tanks by a company called Blue Ocean Barns. Seaweed diet supplements have been developed for use in cow feed because they produce large methane reductions (%2313800). <em>Asparagopsis taxiformis</em>, which is a seaweed produced for human consumption, was found to reduce methane emissions in cows by more than 99%, at fairly low doses (2% of the cow’s total diet). The seaweed contains a compound called bromoform that prevents cows from producing methane as a by-product by altering micro-organisms in the gut. Now, the use of seaweed as a feedstock has been approved by the California Department for Food and Agriculture in the US and is being used in commercially viable dairy farms. The supplement developed is called Brominata, and is made from a dehydrated form <em>A. taxiformis. </em>The addition of this supplement has been shown to reduce methane emissions from cows' burps by up to 80%. In cows, belched methane is lost energy, meaning that if a cow can retain it, then it actually needs less food to create the same amount of milk. Ben &amp; Jerry’s “Project Mootopia” will roll out initially to 15 farms in the U.S. and the Netherlands. The cows will be monitored and all findings will be made public to benefit the entire dairy industry. The company hopes that by 2024 these farms will emit half the industry average for greenhouse gas emissions. One quarter of global methane emissions are produced by cows and improvements like this could make a real difference.</p>",<p>https&%2358;//www.treehugger.com/ben-jerrys-cows-special-diet-methane-emissions-5271624&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160; </p>,<p>Ben &amp; Jerry's Puts Cows on a Special Diet to Curb Methane Emissions</p>,TreeHugger,11/05/2022,Katherine Martinko,"<p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.benjerry.com/whats-new/2022/05/mootopia"">https&%2358;//www.benjerry.com/whats-new/2022/05/mootopia</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//modernfarmer.com/2016/10/seaweed-livestock-methane-emissions/"">https&%2358;//modernfarmer.com/2016/10/seaweed-livestock-methane-emissions/</a></p>",agriculture,dairy farm,,agriculture,,1 - operational work,1 - realised,2 - credible,<p>Agriculture “Greenhouse gas” Methane Emissions Livestock “Methane production” Seaweed “Food supplement” Dairy “Dairy cows” “Dairy industry” </p>,No,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],18/05/2022 14:05,"James, Jennifer",18/05/2022 14:05,"James, Jennifer",0,,,,,Jenny James
15253,18/05/2022,Jenny James,<p>Researchers have developed a new ‘biocement’ using two common waste materials&%2358; industrial carbide sludge and urea.</p>,"<p>The Environment Agency could utilise this new material in construction and flood defence as a more sustainable alternative to cement. Researchers from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore developed the process in which the reaction of urea with calcium ions in industrial carbide sludge forms a hard solid, or precipitate. Firstly, the carbide sludge is treated with an acid to produce soluble calcium. Urea is then added to the soluble calcium to form a cementation solution, then a bacterial culture is added to this. The bacteria from the culture break down the urea in the solution to form carbonate ions. These ions react with the soluble calcium ions in a process called microbially induced calcite precipitation (MICP). This reaction forms calcium carbonate—a solid material that is naturally found in chalk. When this reaction takes place in soil, the precipitate binds soil particles together and fills the gaps between them, creating a compact mass of soil. This results in a strong, less permeable block of biocement. The new material could offers a sustainable and cost-effective method for soil improvement. Uses include; strengthening the ground for construction or excavation, controlling beach erosion, reducing dust or wind erosion in the desert, and building freshwater reservoirs on beaches or in the desert. The team is also exploring further large-scale applications such as road repair, sealing gaps tunnels to prevent water seepage, or even as a growth media for coral reefs as coral larvae are attracted to calcium carbonate. Soil improvement by MICP can meet the requirement of green construction because the process exerts minimal disturbance to the soil and environment. It involves the natural process of in situ urease hydrolysis by selected micro-organisms that can be found in abundance in soil and groundwater. Nevertheless, the MICP technique may not be entirely environmentally friendly. The process may still generate by-products, i.e., ammonium and its oxidized by-product nitrate, which can be hazardous to human health and soil organisms, particularly at high concentrations.</p>","<p><u><a href=""https&%2358;//techxplore.com/news/2022-05-scientists-renewable-biocement-materials.html"">https&%2358;//techxplore.com/news/2022-05-scientists-renewable-biocement-materials.html</a></u></p>",<p>Scientists create renewable biocement made entirely from waste materials</p>,Tech Explore,13/05/2022,,"<p><a href=""https&%2358;//www3.ntu.edu.sg/CorpComms2/research%20papers/Biocement.pdf"">https&%2358;//www3.ntu.edu.sg/CorpComms2/research%20papers/Biocement.pdf</a></p><p>https&%2358;//web.stanford.edu/~wyun/Digital_Library/11-6-2017_Factors%20Af_Soon_et_al.pdf</p>",industry1,cement manufacture,,industry1,,1 - operational work,3 - some development needed,1 - Highly credible,<p>Biocement Sustainable “Sustainable development” Recycling Cement Construction “Carbide sludge” “Material science” </p>,No,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],18/05/2022 14:00,"James, Jennifer",18/05/2022 14:00,"James, Jennifer",0,,,,,Jenny James

Glowee uses a marine bacterium collected off the coast of France called Aliivibrio fischeri is used to produce bioluminescent the light. The bacteria are stored inside saltwater-filled tubes, allowing them to circulate freely. Since the light is generated through internal biochemical processes that are part of the organism's normal metabolism, running it requires almost no energy other than the nutrients needed to produce the food the bacteria consume. A mix of basic nutrients is added and air is pumped through the water to provide oxygen. To &quot;turn off the lights&quot;, the air is simply cut off, halting the process by sending the bacteria into an anaerobic state where it does not produce bioluminescence. The manufacturing process, consumes less water than manufacturing LEDs and releases less CO2, while the liquid is also biodegradable. The lights also use less electricity to run than LEDs, according to the company, Carl Johnson, professor of biological sciences at Vanderbilt University, believes there are serious challenges. These challenges include; providing enough nutrients, diluting the bacteria as they grow, temperature dependence of the bioluminescent reaction, extending duration of bioluminescence and increasing the brightness. As an alternative, Glowee is investigating &quot;chemiluminescence&quot;, the chemical process that produces bioluminescence and removes the need for live bacteria. A separate group in Russia have developed bioluminescent plants able to glow 10 times brighter and for longer than previous efforts which could offer an alternative solution to Glowee’s luminescent tubes. </p>",<p>https&%2358;//www.bbc.com/future/article/20220407-the-living-lights-that-could-reduce-energy-use</p>,<p>The French town where the lighting is alive</p>,BBC,11/04/2022,Peter Yeung,"<p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0500-9"">Plants with genetically encoded autoluminescence | Nature Biotechnology</a></p>",industry2,technology,biotechnology,resources,microbial resource,1 - operational work,4 - signficant development needed,2 - credible,<p>Bioluminescent Bioluminescence Lighting “Natural lighting” Sustainability “Nature based solutions” Chemiluminescence “Urban lighting” “Street lights”</p>,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],06/06/2022 14:41,"Dinsdale, Jason",18/05/2022 13:56,"James, Jennifer",0,,,,,Jenny James

They concluded that with renewables there could be even a four - six months’ gaps in energy in future, or even a year of a so-called ‘energy drought’, hence backup energy sources are always required, something that should be of interest to Environment Agency. The threshold level for changing wind and solar patterns was established at the 30th percentile, meaning if 30 % are low production days this may lead to an energy drought. The study was conducted in Texas because the state is the largest generator of wind power and the fifth largest solar power producer, additionally the state already has a grid larger than many countries do. The recommendation is for this research to guide investment decision-making for renewable energy sources as we combat climate change, to ensure we split the risk by investing in multiple technologies. For the next stage of the research project, the focus is on forecasting energy floods, not just periods of energy droughts.</p>","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//news.columbia.edu/news/could-energy-droughts-be-next"">https&%2358;//news.columbia.edu/news/could-energy-droughts-be-next</a></p>",<p>You've heard of water droughts.

15246,12/05/2022,Liisa Tang,<p>Construction for world’s biggest and nature-centred animal crossing in California has started with mainly private funding.</p>,"<p>The Wallis Annenberg Wildlife Crossing in California is a new restoration project, mainly funded by private donations, bringing novel design and scale for wildlife crossings, allowing especially nocturnal animals pass safely without noise, light or scent from humans. The novel consequence to Environment Agency and Natural England, who already build habitat corridors and do habitat restoration, is that we may have a larger scale need for more wildlife crossings as wildfires become more frequent with climate change, especially with peat areas on the Pennines at risk. The highway with ten lanes has been lethal for many animal species especially the protected mountain lions, and the new 210-foot long, 165-foot wide has sound walls and is topped with soil and native vegetation and provides a safe pass in the mountains. The studies demonstrate that it can take even five years for some species to learn to use a wildlife corridor such as this, with the smaller species becoming comfortable of accessing it before the large mammals. Not only the freedom of movement across habitats may enhance genetic variety for rare species in future, but this crossing also sets a precedent for use of nature-centric design in rewilding and habitat restoration. As this highway location has over 300,00 cars crossing daily, investing in wildlife crossing makes sense from economic and human safety point of view. A study from Banff National Park in Canada, where they increased the number of both under and overpasses, establishes that<strong> </strong>there was a 90 per cent decrease in collisions between wildlife and vehicles.</p>","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.ecowatch.com/worlds-largest-wildlife-crossing-california.html"">https&%2358;//www.ecowatch.com/worlds-largest-wildlife-crossing-california.html</a></p>",World’s Largest Wildlife Crossing Will Soon Stretch Across California’s Highway 101,Ecowatch,11/04/2022,"Hemingway Jaynes, Cristen","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/09/wildlife-bridge-california-highway-mountain-lions"">https&%2358;//www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/09/wildlife-bridge-california-highway-mountain-lions</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.pc.gc.ca/en/pn-np/ab/banff/info/gestion-management/enviro/transport/tch-rtc/passages-crossings/faq/10"">https&%2358;//www.pc.gc.ca/en/pn-np/ab/banff/info/gestion-management/enviro/transport/tch-rtc/passages-crossings/faq/10</a></p>",biology1,habitat,wildlife habitat,biology2,animal ecology,1 - operational work,3 - some development needed,2 - credible,<p>Animals California conservation wildlife habitats roads traffic “habitat corridors” “wildlife crossings” “habitat restoration” fragmentation connectivity “endangered species” wildfires “Wallis Annenberg” “genetic diversity” “sound walls”</p>,No,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],18/05/2022 13:22,"Loveday, Tim",12/05/2022 14:47,"Tang, Liisa",0,,,,,Liisa Tang
15245,11/05/2022,Jenny James,<p>CRISPR tool reverse one big consequence of &quot;teenage&quot; drinking in rats</p>,"<p>The Environment Agency should monitor the development of novel epigenetic editing tools as they offer potential for future treatment of DNA damage caused chemical substances, such as pesticides. Epigenetic editing has been used to reverse the impacts of teenage binge drinking in rats. Epigenetics refers to changes in gene expression rather than the gene itself. Binge drinking during adolescence has a serious impact on the brain. One of the consequences of heavy drinking is a change in the gene that influences the operation of part of the brain. This change can cause anxiety in later life. Adolescent binge drinking is also a major risk factor for psychiatric disorders later in life including alcohol use disorder. Adolescent alcohol exposure induces epigenetic reprogramming and decreases Arc (a cytoskeleton protein) expression in the amygdala of both rodents and humans. Researchers used a gene-editing tool called CRISPR-dCas9 to physically manipulate the DNA by histone acetylation and removing deficits in Arc expression, leading to attenuation of adult anxiety and excessive alcohol drinking in a rat model of adolescent alcohol exposure. In the past CRISPR has been used to treat genetic disorders such as sickle cell disease via direct gene editing. This research illustrates the possibility of repairing DNA damage using CRISPR, rather than cutting and editing DNA directly. The development of novel epigenetic editing tools allows for the treatment DNA damage and gene expression potentially could be used to repair damage caused by a range of factors, such as chemical exposure.</p>","<p><u><a href=""https&%2358;//interestingengineering.com/crispr-teenage-drinking-rats"">https&%2358;//interestingengineering.com/crispr-teenage-drinking-rats</a></u></p>",<p>CRISPR tool reverse one big consequence of &quot;teenage&quot; drinking in rats</p>,Interesting Engineering,04/05/2022,Grant Currin,"<p><u><a href=""https&%2358;//www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abn2748?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D06014244086116235383178190111199253169%7cMCORGID%3D242B6472541199F70A4C98A6%2540AdobeOrg%7cTS%3D1651694942&amp;_ga=2.96362716.1946089263.1651499680-33919792.1644247394"">https&%2358;//www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abn2748?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D06014244086116235383178190111199253169%7CMCORGID%3D242B6472541199F70A4C98A6%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1651694942&amp;_ga=2.96362716.1946089263.1651499680-33919792.1644247394</a></u></p>",biology1,DNA,,human health,,4 - possible future remit,4 - signficant development needed,1 - Highly credible,<p>CRISPR Epigenetics Genetics “Epigenetic editing” “Disease treatment” “DNA damage” Alcoholism “Gene expression” </p>,No,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],21/11/2022 16:40,"James, Jennifer",11/05/2022 14:38,"James, Jennifer",0,,,,,Jenny James

The implications to Environment Agency are that this needs to be considered from biodiversity perspective and to inform urban planning, management and policies since urban trees provide well-being value for human health and happiness, reduce air pollution, collect dust and in other ways are great nature-based solutions. Many cities tend to do monoculture planting which increases the risk of invasive species impacts, and the financial impacts of removing dead trees and replacing them at this scale is considerable. According to The British Ecological Society, 90% of trees will be attacked by emerald ash borer larvae, and in “mortality hot spots” including New York City and Chicago, even 95% of trees, particularly killing all ash trees. In future, other wood borer species are likely to attack maples and oaks in a similar manner. The cost to the society will be on average of US$ 30&%23160;million annually.

15239,28/04/2022,Jenny James,<p>Researchers have created a polymer membrane that improves efficiency of carbon dioxide capture from mixed gasses.</p>,"<p>Carbon capture will be necessary in order to meet the UK’s net zero targets and the Environment Agency as a regulatory body should take an interest in the development of this technology. Membranes are an attractive technology for removing CO2 from mixed gases because they do not take up much physical space, they can be made in a wide variety of sizes, and they can be easily replaced. The membrane developed in this study focussed on the removal of CO2 from mixed gasses such as those emitted from power plants. They were able to improve the selectivity CO2 removal, while retaining relatively high CO2 permeability for both CO2/ nitrogen and CO2/ methane mixtures. These gas mixtures are particularly relevant in the context of reducing greenhouse gas emission from power plants. These membranes work by allowing CO2 to pass through more quickly than other gasses, meaning you end up with a higher percentage of CO2 compared to other gasses on the other side of the membrane. The gas that passes through the membrane can be captured and removed. In the past membrane filters have struggled to deal with the issue of permeability versus selectivity. The more permeable a membrane is, the faster gasses can pass through. However, more permeable membranes are less selective, allowing non-target gas through at the same time. To tackle this the team grew hydrophilic and CO2-philic polymer chains on the membrane surface which increased selectivity with little impact on permeability. This work was a proof-of-concept and optimisation, scaling and cost need to be addressed in future research. Membranes offer an alternative to CO2 absorption which have a significantly larger footprint, and use liquid amines that tend to be toxic and corrosive.</p>","<p><u><a href=""https&%2358;//www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/04/220401122134.htm"">https&%2358;//www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/04/220401122134.htm</a></u></p>",<p>New polymer membrane tech improves efficiency of carbon dioxide capture</p>,Science Daily,01/04/2022,,,pollution1,emission reduction,waste gas reduction,pollution2,,1 - operational work,4 - signficant development needed,1 - Highly credible,<p>CO2 “Carbon dioxide” “Carbon capture” Membrane “Membrane filter” “CO2 filter” “Polymer membrane”</p>,No,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],18/05/2022 13:22,"Loveday, Tim",28/04/2022 14:50,"James, Jennifer",0,,,,,Jenny James
15238,28/04/2022,Jenny James,<p>A mass demonstration swim is planned at Kinder Reservoir in the Peak District to protest the lack of access to open water swimming sites in England. </p>,"<p>The Environment Agency regulates the water companies that own these reservoirs and they may be liable if an accident occurs. In addition, swimming may increase contamination of the water – with cosmetics like sun cream known to be damaging to wildlife. The Environment Agency may want to consider initiating a “before and after” contamination study to investigate impacts if swimming is permitted. This “swimpass” is reminiscent of the Kinder mass-trespass of 1932, which protested the lack of countryside access and eventually led to the creation of the UK’s first national park. Organised by the Outdoor Swimming Society (OSS) who dispute the “widespread lack of undisputed access to inland open water in England and Wales, and the disconnect this causes between people, water, and each other”. Concerns over safety have been the main counter-argument by United Utilities who own the reservoir and operate a blanket no swimming ban. The OSS argues that water companies have a statutory duty to provide recreational access to waterways, not just for angling and dog walking but also swimming.

There seems to have been something of a nano-revolution brewing, with nano-particles providing the ‘magic ingredient’ for a range of innovations, often marketed as eco-friendly. Even Ikea have capitalised on this trend, adding “air purifying” titanium dioxide to curtains. Nano-particles include any molecule smaller than 100 nanometres (a human hair is approximately 80,000nm thick). Although nano-particles exist in nature, they can be manufactured and their small size means that they have a range of useful properties. In medicine, they can transport cancer drugs directly into tumour cells, in agriculture they could direct pesticides to specific parts of a plant. Already nano-silver is added to textiles to provide antimicrobial activity. Scientists are worried that nano-particles will end up in the environment, particularly through washing of nano-infused clothes. Some nano particles have been shown to negatively affect marine wildlife including fish and crustaceans and resistance to antimicrobial nano-silver can develop – silver-tolerant soil bacteria have now been found. Little is known even about where nanoparticles are, let alone their effects on the environment. As they are so tiny, most experiments are conducted in labs, and it can be hard to pin down where they are applied. Scientists are concerned that nano particles could bind to and transport toxic pollutants, and possibly be toxic themselves by generating reactive free radicals. By binding to toxic compounds these nano particles could act as toxic delivery systems, able to be absorbed by marine organisms. From August, the EU will ban use of TiO2 in food (where it is called E171) and the European Commission recently announced that 12 nanomaterials would soon be prohibited in cosmetics. </p>","<p><u><a href=""https&%2358;//www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/25/nano-state-tiny-and-now-everywhere-how-big-a-problem-are-nanoparticles"">https&%2358;//www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/25/nano-state-tiny-and-now-everywhere-how-big-a-problem-are-nanoparticles</a></u></p>","<p>Nano state&%2358; tiny and now everywhere, how big a problem are nanoparticles?</p>",The Guardian,25/04/2022,Anna Turns,,pollution1,biological contamination,,pollution2,,1 - operational work,2 - near to realisation,2 - credible,<p>Nano-particles “Nano particles” “Environmental endpoints” “Harmful effects” “Environmental impact” “Materials science” “Toxic particles” “Water contamination” </p>,No,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],18/05/2022 13:22,"Loveday, Tim",28/04/2022 14:21,"James, Jennifer",0,,,,,Jenny James

Where other social media companies have shirked their responsibility on the spread of misinformation on their platforms, Pintrest is setting a precedent in this field. The image-based social media company will remove content that denies or distorts facts about climate change. The move by Pintrest could also create a ‘bubble’ effect where mainstream platforms are ‘sanitised’ and only certain, less conventional platforms deal in disinformation. In contrast, Elon Musk, who is a free speech advocate, has made an offer to buy Twitter and may be keen to influence the company on this issue, counter to the move made by Pintrest. In addition, the relevance of Pintrest as a social media platform is also debatable, with only 431 million, compared to 540 million on Telegram and 1 billion on TikTok. Therefore this move may be less impactful than hoped. The demographics of users on social media platforms varies, with younger users tending toward TikTok (the largest age group being 10 to 19 year olds) and older users tending toward Pintrest (Largest age group being 50-64).

The product is part of a new class, known as ‘warm mix asphalts’ which are produced at temperatures of up to 40°C lower than ordinary asphalt. Switching to warm mix asphalts, therefore, would save roughly 61,000 tonnes of CO2 each year in the UK, which is the equivalent of reducing 300 million miles of automobile travel. The novelty, developed by researchers at the University of Swansea and the Technical University of Braunschweig, is the addition of engineered clay/fumed silica nanocomposites during the production of the asphalt. This acts as a binding material and provides anti-aging properties to the asphalt. Not only this, the new mixture serves to further reduce temperatures and also overcomes significant limitations caused by moisture susceptibility in the asphalt.

However, the Portsmouth team revealed that an enzyme from PET-consuming bacteria recognises TPA like a hand in a glove. The group then demonstrated that this enzyme, called TPADO, breaks down TPA and pretty much only TPA, with amazing efficiency. The break down products could potentially be used for other applications or be broken down further. More than 400 million tons of plastic waste is produced each year and the overwhelming majority of this ends up in landfills.

Bitcoin has gained attention and concern from the environmental community due to the significant energy and hardware resources required to ‘mine’ it, i.e. process transactions on the Bitcoin decentralised network. Verifying a transaction involves solving a complex mathematical equation, for which the solver is paid a fraction of Bitcoin. In order to remain competitive and profitable Bitcoin miners must constantly invest in faster processing hardware and the energy needed to run large Bitcoin mining operations. Sites such as defunct aluminium smelting plants (%2315142) have been repurposed for mining. It is currently estimated that Bitcoin mining has the equivalent energy footprint of Sweden. A campaign called Change the Code Not the Climate is coordinated by Environmental Working Group, Greenpeace USA and several groups battling the impacts of bitcoin mining facilities in their communities. They are calling on the Bitcoin community to change the way bitcoins are mined to greatly reduce its carbon footprint. Rival cryptocurrencies, such as Etherium, have already moved from the energy intensive “proof of work” verification to “proof of stake”, which could reduce energy consumption by 99 per cent. &%23160;With proof of stake, miners pledge their coins to verify transactions with inaccurate information leading to penalties. The campaigners argue that as the World’s biggest virtual currency that Bitcoin needs to follow Etherium’s example, otherwise its continuation incentivises greater energy use, which renewables would be unable to meet. Other protocols exist for processing virtual currency payments which have advantages over Bitcoin in terms of energy efficiency (%2314124) and volume (%2314281), which could suggest that unless Bitcoin changes environmental concerns could lead to it being abandoned for other less impactful currencies.&%23160;</p>",<p>https&%2358;//www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/mar/29/bitcoin-reduce-energy-consumption-climate-groups</p>,<p>Climate groups say a change in coding can reduce bitcoin energy consumption by 99%</p>,The Guardian,29/03/2022,"Rushe, D",,energy,electricity consumption,,climate,,1 - operational work,3 - some development needed,2 - credible,<p>energy &quot;climate change&quot; &quot;virtual currency&quot; cryptocurrency cryptocurrencies BitCoin Etherium resource carbon renewable hardware mining Greenpeace &quot;Environmental Working Group&quot; Sweden &quot;Change the Code Not the Climate&quot; regulation information technology IT</p>,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],18/05/2022 11:46,"Loveday, Tim",06/04/2022 13:34,"Dinsdale, Jason",0,,,,,Jason Dinsdale

If this proves to be a profitable activity in the UK, it may have an impact air quality and climate targets by encouraging flaring under the guise of reducing waste gas. Currently Exon Mobil is piloting the scheme in cooperation with Crusoe Energy Systems Inc. in North Dakota, utilising up to 18 million cubic feet of gas per month that would have otherwise been wasted due to a lack of pipelines. The excess gas is used to generate electricity which powers large Bitcoin mining servers meaning that “greenhouse gas emissions are not simply created as waste”.

Currently the project is aiming to ‘fingerprint’ the chemical properties of weathered plastic on a broad scale, so that, for example, crisp packets or bottles can be identified from microplastic samples. However, as the fingerprinting library becomes more detailed it might be possible to trace microplastics back to specific manufacturers. Improved understanding of the lifecycle of microplastics will help to pinpoint and eliminate major contributing sources as well as persistent sources. The project as a whole has four major objectives; Firstly to improve microplastic detection, secondly to track movement and fate of microplastics, third to assess climate vulnerability and finally to reduce point source inputs.

Ethylene can then be used to create a range of products including tyres and food packaging. This process allows the removal of greenhouse gasses while at the same time creating useful materials.

The turbine blades, which need to be light weight and robust, have been constructed using fibreglass (%2314254) and thermosetting plastic foam. The resin used in the turbine blade can be chemically treated to depolymerise and separate from the fibre, which can be reused again. In addition to this, the production method is automated which has the benefit of reduced waste as well as reduced energy consumption. Wind turbines are designed to last around 20 to 25 years and estimates suggest that 720,000 tonnes of wind turbine material will need to be disposed of over the next 20 years. The project was run by LM Wind Power, a GE's renewable energy company, and brought together experts from manufacturing, material science and recycling to develop the blade. The project is now conducting full scale testing after which validation of the recycling procedure will be run. This is due to be completed be 2023 after which time the blades will begin to be manufactured commercially. Elsewhere a Polish real estate developer has established a project for repurposing discarded wind turbine blades as architectural features. Turbines are currently constructed of difficult to recycle composite materials, which otherwise could be destined for landfill. Yareal has devised designs to repurpose segments of discarded blades as street furniture such as shelters and seating, as well as a footbridge constructed of recycled turbine blade parts. By 2023 14,000 wind turbine blades in Europe alone will reach the end of their lifespan, equating to 60,000 tonnes of composite waste.

15223,23/03/2022,Jenny James,<p>Researchers in Florida have identified a low bias method of amplifying trustworthy news sources on social media. </p>,"<p>Disinformation that propagates over social media impacts public opinion on issues that are important to the Environment Agency such as climate change and can even influence political outcomes such as in the Brexit referendum. Disinformation spreads quickly on social media because engagement is used as a measure to boost posts within like-minded communities and users are shown similar posts to those that they have engaged with in the past. On top of this, low quality content that confirms what you already believe is engaging and this exacerbates the development of conspiracy theories. Researchers are attempting to break this cycle by looking for engaging posts that are aimed at a diverse audience. Rather than focusing on the number of views, the new algorithm uses a reliability score and the political diversity of their audience to boost content. Previously social media platforms have been reluctant to integrate algorithms that filter out misinformation due to the potential for partisan bias to be introduced. However, this algorithm specifically boosts content with a politically dispersed audience, which also tend to be more reliable. Researchers say that platforms could easily include audience diversity into their own recommendation algorithms because “diversity measures can be derived from engagement data, and platforms already log this type of data whenever users click &quot;like&quot; or share something on a newsfeed”.</p>","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/02/220203122858.htm"">https&%2358;//www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/02/220203122858.htm</a></p>",<p>Researchers find new way to amplify trustworthy news content on social media without shielding bias</p>,Science Daily,03/02/2022,,,"social aspects, population",access to information,,information,,3 - influencing role,3 - some development needed,2 - credible,<p>Misinformation Disinformation &quot;Conspiracy theory&quot; &quot;Social media&quot; &quot;Trusted source&quot; &quot;Media content&quot; &quot;User engagement&quot; Algorithm&%23160;</p>,No,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],18/05/2022 11:46,"Loveday, Tim",23/03/2022 12:36,"James, Jennifer",0,,,,,Jenny James
15222,23/03/2022,Jenny James,"<p>Several research groups have developed mechanisms to genetically modify pest insects causing them to produce sterile offspring and plans to release billions of these GM insects has been approved in America, but don’t worry because researchers have engineered a genetic kill switch to help quell concerns about modified genetic material escaping to the environment.</p>","<p>The move toward genetic modification for pest control should be of interest to DEFRA and the Environment Agency because it may reduce reliance on damaging pesticides, however, unforeseen impacts of releasing GM insects into the environment should be monitored. The Environmental Protection Agency has approved plans by the biotech company Oxitec to release billions of male mosquitos with a modified gene that allows the expression of a protein called tTAV-OX5034. When these modified males reproduce with wild females the protein expression kills the female offspring. The hope is to reduce the spread of mosquito-borne diseases, however, Friends of the Earth have already raised concerns because genetic material from modified mosquitoes has been found in wild populations at significant levels suggesting that the mosquitos are not fully sterile. In addition, evolutionary pressure may drive new hybridisations between different species. The second species being targeted by researchers at North Carolina University is a type of fruit fly that can devastate fruit crops. The flies are modified with a female lethal gene that works when a common antibiotic is not provided in larval diets. Researchers at Washington State University are working on creating a kill switch – currently only targeting microbes – which integrates into any genetically engineered microbe, causing it to self-destruct under certain defined conditions. If a similar mechanism could be introduced into GM insects to allow activation of an emergency kill switch in the event of unforeseen environmental damage, this could improve confidence in the research. However, combating damage caused by genetic modification with more genetic modification seems somewhat risky and will be a hard sell to the public. &%23160;</p><p>&%23160;</p>","<p><u><a href=""https&%2358;//interestingengineering.com/epa-genetically-modified-mosquitos"">https&%2358;//interestingengineering.com/epa-genetically-modified-mosquitos</a></u></p>",<p>The EPA approves plans to release billions of genetically modified mosquitos.</p>,Interesting Engineering,11/03/2022,Loukia Papadopoulos,"<p><u><a href=""https&%2358;//www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/06/210629134314.htm"">https&%2358;//www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/06/210629134314.htm</a></u></p><p>https&%2358;//www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/02/220209154956.htm</p>",research,genetic engineering,reproductive manipulation,biology1,,1 - operational work,2 - near to realisation,2 - credible,<p>GM &quot;Pest control&quot; &quot;Genetic engineering&quot; &quot;Genetic modification&quot; &quot;Disease control&quot; Sterilisation Mosquito&%23160;</p>,No,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],18/05/2022 11:46,"Loveday, Tim",23/03/2022 12:02,"James, Jennifer",0,,,,,Jenny James

Paris is to host the Olympic Games in 2024, and there is an ambition to be able to hold swimming events in the Seine. However swimming has been banned in the river since 1923 due to pollution leading to poor water quality. Several administrations have attempted to clean the river in the past but with limited success, although fish species diversity has markedly improved. A canal in Paris is now open to swimming however this has to close periodically as water quality deteriorates. In order to fulfil the current ambition Paris is constructing a giant subterranean stormwater storage tank which will prevent sewage overflow during heavy rains. Sewage will then be pumped back into the water treatment system once heavy rain has passed. It will cost 1.4 billion euros ($1.6 billion) and have a capacity of 46,000 cubic metres. However it will still not be large enough to capture all estimated discharges, meaning that 100,000 cubic metres will still enter the river each year, creating ‘no swim’ conditions periodically. In Germany Berlin is creating a similar scheme on a branch of the river Spree which will reed beds to treat and clean water entering the river. A private funded scheme is also looking to introduce bathing pools sitting on the Thames in London, fed by river water. The Olympics are a major global media event, which could mean that, should Paris be successful in cleaning up the Seine, coverage could spark interest in similar ambitions in other cities around the World. Similar initiatives to Paris could help the Environment Agency and partners achieve its ambitions around water quality and public access to blue space. However, as recently demonstrated by activist groups who recently managed to achieve bathing water recognition for the River Wharfe in Ilkley, new bathing water designations could lead to greater monitoring and regulatory activity for the Environment Agency.&%23160;</p>",<p>https&%2358;//www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-04/how-paris-plans-to-make-the-seine-swimmable-by-2024</p>,<p>Paris has a new plan to make the Seine swimmable</p>,Bloomberg,21/12/2021,"O'Sullivan, F","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/swim-in-seine-paris-olympics-b1983810.html"">Will we be able to once again swim in the Seine? | The Independent</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-60044492"">Ilkley River Wharfe bathing site gets 'poor' water quality rating - BBC News</a></p>",water2,water quality,,water1,,1 - operational work,3 - some development needed,2 - credible,<p>water &quot;water quality&quot; river city urban &quot;blue space&quot; Paris Seine Olympic swimming recreation sewage storm flood run-off pollution pollutant monitoring Wharfe Ilkley activist regulation storage canal reed bed Berlin Germany France London Thames communication media 2024 infrastructure</p>,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],18/05/2022 11:46,"Loveday, Tim",23/03/2022 10:39,"Dinsdale, Jason",0,,,,,Jason Dinsdale

The new desalination system overcomes a previous problem of salt accumulation (build-up) on components, which has previously hindered efficiency. The resulting wick free layered system consists of a dark heat absorbing material on the top which first absorbs the sun’s heat. A second thin perforated layer of water sits atop a reservoir of salt water. The sun’s heat generates a convective flow which draws salt out of the warm thin layer and down into the reservoir. While many similar systems have focussed on the use of advanced materials, this system consists of cheap and readily available materials. A one metre square device capable of providing enough water for one family would cost around $4, and there are the opportunities to scale up. The developers see their system as being particularly applicable in off-grid locations and disaster relief. The system could be used to desalinate water from a variety of sources including seawater, brine, or brackish groundwater. While primarily designed with the developing World in mind, the Environment Agency could see similar systems deployed in the UK, either to contribute to large desalination installations, or to provide smaller decentralised utility provision in community and domestic settings, providing owners with water independence from water companies and opening up a wider variety of water sources.

This new study found that providing photosynthetic bacteria, or cyanobacteria with the right home conditions greatly increases the amount of electricity they could produce, to a level where its solar conversion efficiencies outcompetes many biofuel generation methods. Cyanobacteria need lots of sunlight to perform photosynthesis well. The 3D printed ‘nano skyscrapers’ help to increase the bacteria’s surface area and therefore photosynthesise more efficiently.

15217,22/03/2022,Jason Dinsdale,<p>Post pandemic changes in working practices are leading to more initiatives to explore the concept of a four day working week.</p>,"<p>The Environment Agency, as with all employers should consider how large scale changes like this could impact on its business activities. One of the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic and its associated lockdowns has been many people reassessing their working lives, spurred arguably through the move to more remote working and home working. This has been termed ‘The Great Resignation’ as a wave of workers quit their jobs and move to roles more in line with their new priorities. A consequence of this has been that corporations are having to address the resulting skill shortage with better pay, terms and conditions, plus other perks to tempt and retain workers. These include better maternity arrangements, extra leave for pet adoption, and even cash just to attend interviews. One analyst identifies employers demonstrating care for staff well-being and future success being seen as a greater benefit than ‘perks’. Against this backdrop, some countries are starting to experiment with the notion of a four day week. In Belgium new labour reforms have given workers the right to request a four day working week. Employers will have to justify why employees couldn’t take this option. Employees will have to condense their contracted hours into a four day period, rather than work less time, but will have an extra non-working day a week. Workers are entitled to try the format for a period of six months, after which they can either continue or revert back to a five day week without penalty. It is expected that it will take time for the reforms to make it into legislation. In Wales, the future generations commissioner Sophie Howe has called for the Welsh Government to trial a shorter working week in the public sector. Many people are supportive of the move, which could create a deficit of 27,000 employees and an initial cost of £1bn. However a better work life balance could lead to other benefits such less sickness leave, less pollution due to less commuting, and a 10 per cent increase in efficiency across the public sector would offset the initial costs in the long term. One Cardiff hairdressing salon is already applying the four day work principle with staff reporting greater levels of energy, well-being and work engagement. The Environment Agency already embraces flexible working and compressed hours for some employees. As moves towards shorter working weeks gain legislative traction, the Environment Agency may need to consider what steps may need to be taken to address any potential shortfalls in business cover, plus additional costs and opportunities to offset these through greater efficiencies. There may also need to be considerations of current salary and benefit offers to ensure that we remain competitive across a changing public and private sector.</p>",<p>https&%2358;//www.theguardian.com/money/2022/feb/14/welsh-government-urged-trial-four-day-week-public-sector</p>,<p>Welsh government urged to trial four-day week for public sector</p>,The Guardian,14/02/2022,"Morris, S","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.wired.co.uk/article/great-resignation-perks-tech"">After the Great Resignation, Tech Firms Are Getting Desperate | WIRED UK</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.euronews.com/next/2022/02/15/belgium-approves-four-day-week-and-gives-employees-the-right-to-ignore-their-bosses"">Belgium approves four-day week and gives employees the right to ignore their bosses after work | Euronews</a></p>",economics2,working hours,,human health,,1 - operational work,4 - signficant development needed,2 - credible,<p>workforce employment employer employee wage salary benefit &quot;four day week&quot; compressed hours Wales Belgium legislation law recruitment public sector private sector coronavirus pandemic lockdown Covid-19 &quot;Great Resignation&quot; regulation office remote working flexible&%23160;</p>,No,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],18/05/2022 11:46,"Loveday, Tim",22/03/2022 09:58,"Dinsdale, Jason",0,,,,,Jason Dinsdale

At the time house prices were reported to have collapsed, leaving residents with a loss of capital needed to relocate. However, Fairbourne has experienced a recent property boom following a surge of interest from prospective buyers, with prices increasing 35 per cent in the last year. This flies in the face of other research which suggests that in some parts of the World property purchasers may be becoming more cautious towards climate change impacts on their investments (%2314992). Prices started to climb during the coronavirus pandemic from an increase in UK based holidays. It is now estimated that a quarter of Fairbourne’s properties are second homes, all of which have been purchased by cash buyers - no lenders are prepared to approve mortgages due to the inevitable sea level impacts. Many buyers are reported to be retired people who accept Fairbourne’s fate but are worried about the longer term consequences in 25 years' time. Others are looking at buy-to-let holiday homes, where they believe they may be able to recoup their initial investment regardless of the longer term consequences. Coastal areas have traditionally attracted retired people and in this sense Fairbourne is no different. However the prominence of Fairbourne’s precarious status in the media may influence the narrative around coastal retreat more difficult for the Environment Agency and partners to influence.

15214,17/03/2022,Jason Dinsdale,<p>Indoor vertical farming seems increasingly to be heading towards mainstream food production.</p>,"<p>The Environment Agency should be interested in this trajectory as indoor vertical farming promises to deliver significant water use and pesticide reductions as well as repositioning food production as a potentially more urban activity with point source discharges, compared to the current situation of rural based, diffuse discharges. The World’s largest vertical farm is currently being constructed on a four acre site in Norfolk. The Norfolk facility is being developed by Fischer Farms, who already operate a large vertical farm in Staffordshire. The four acre site will create 25,000 m² of growing space, which will supply over six tonnes of fresh produce every day, including leafy greens (rocket, lettuce etc.) and herbs. Crops are grown in controlled environments let by LEDs. The equivalent quantity of produce would require 1000 acres of conventional British farmland. Fischer farms plan to move to growing competitively priced soya beans, rice and wheat in significant volumes over the next 10-15 years. The site is powered by renewable energy and also avoids issues associated with traditional farming such as topsoil erosion or chemical run-off. Across the Atlantic a vertical farming company has just signed a deal with a major US retailer. San Francisco based Plenty has just received a $400 million investment from Walmart, with a look to provide leafy greens to its California stores, signalling a turning point for the mass appeal of vertical farmed produce. Plenty are also looking to provide other perishables, including strawberries and tomatoes. Vertical farming looks to be diversifying into a range of crops, not just perishables, which has the potential to significantly change farming practices, rural landscapes and economies.

15213,17/03/2022,Jenny James,<p>A UN report introduces the concept of ‘sacrifice zones’ where air pollution is so high that public health suffers significantly. </p>,"<p>The Environment Agency should be aware of this branding and potential reputational damage that would be incurred if areas of England were labelled ‘sacrifice zones’ in the media. With air quality being linked to more health conditions and the death of Ella Kissi-Debrah in 2020 (which was linked to air pollution), advocacy groups could use the term to highlight problem areas in England. In addition, many of the business that are regulated be the Environment Agency are considered to be exacerbating the issue, prioritising profits over public health. Sacrifice zones tend to be in poorer areas of the world, however, the USA is highlighted as having several sacrifice zones including Louisiana’s ‘cancer alley’. The report names several of specific region in Europe that are already considered sacrifice zones and a separate recent publication in Nature highlights a link between localised pollution and cardiac dyspnoea in the South of France. The report highlights the intensity of this crisis with reporting that&%2358; One in six deaths in the world involves diseases caused by pollution; and in Kabwe, Zambia, 95% of children had elevated levels of lead in their blood, putting them at risk of lifelong intellectual impairment. The Royal College of Physicians report that 40,000 deaths in the UK per year are attributed to outdoor exposure to air pollution. The rise of HVAC air filters during the covid pandemic may take on another function if air quality continues to worsen, providing safe air in public spaces. The tendency for low air quality to be focussed in poorer areas will likely lead to a demand for low cost air filtration and the covid pandemic has led to a number of low cost filtration designs that can be assembled from easily purchased parts. </p>",<p>https&%2358;//www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/10/millions-suffering-in-deadly-pollution-sacrifice-zones-warns-un-expert</p>,"<p>Millions suffering in deadly pollution ‘sacrifice zones’, warns UN expert</p>",The Guardian,10/03/2022,Damien Gayle ,"<p><a href=""https&%2358;//documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G22/004/48/pdf/G2200448.pdf?OpenElement"">https&%2358;//documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G22/004/48/pdf/G2200448.pdf?OpenElement</a></p><p>https&%2358;//www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-05827-2%20</p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.clydeco.com/en/insights/2021/12/air-pollution-exposures-for-organisations"">https&%2358;//www.clydeco.com/en/insights/2021/12/air-pollution-exposures-for-organisations</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.shoutoutuk.org/2021/03/09/sacrifice-zones-how-covid-19-exposed-environmental-racism/"">https&%2358;//www.shoutoutuk.org/2021/03/09/sacrifice-zones-how-covid-19-exposed-environmental-racism/</a></p><p>https&%2358;//www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/homemade-air-purifier-thats-been-saving-lives-during-covid-19-pandemic-180979681/</p>",air,air quality,air quality impact,air,outdoor air pollution,3 - influencing role,2 - near to realisation,2 - credible,<p>&quot;Sacrifice zones&quot; &quot;Air quality&quot; &quot;Air pollution&quot; &quot;Public health&quot; &quot;Air filtration&quot; &quot;Regulated business&quot; Pollution</p>,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,,,,,,[],18/05/2022 11:46,"Loveday, Tim",17/03/2022 11:48,"James, Jennifer",0,,,,,Jenny James

Solar panel cleaning is thought to use up to 5million gallons of water per 100MW of electricity generated and dust on solar panels can reduce the output of photovoltaic panels by as much as 30 percent in just one month. In addition, water cleaning of solar panels can make up 10% of the operating costs at some solar farms. This system can be operated automatically using a simple electric motor and guide rails along the side of the panel. To activate the system, a simple electrode passes just above the solar panel’s surface, imparting an electrical charge to the dust particles, which are then repelled by a charge applied to the panel itself. The electrostatic repulsion generated caused dust particles to ‘jump’ off the surface of the solar panel. Although the electrodes require a high voltage, because the electrodes are separate there is no current generated and therefore very minimal power is required. </p>","<p><u><a href=""https&%2358;//sustainability.mit.edu/article/how-clean-solar-panels-without-water"">https&%2358;//sustainability.mit.edu/article/how-clean-solar-panels-without-water</a></u></p>",<p>How to clean solar panels without water</p>,MIT,11/03/2022,David L.

Micro-pollutants are hazardous to human and environmental health even at very low concentrations and current water treatment methods are largely ineffective on this type of pollutant. Currently, the most common practice for removing micro-pollutants from water is activated carbon adsorption. In this process, water passes through a carbon filter, removing only 30 percent of micro-pollutants. Activated carbon requires high temperatures to produce and regenerate, requiring specialized equipment and consuming large amounts of energy. With this new method, when water comes in contact with soap, the hydrophobic parts of the surfactant stick together, assembling into spherical structures called micelles. These micelles are chemically bonded to a hydrogel using ultraviolet light. When water flows through the micro-particle system, micro-pollutants latch onto the micelles and separate from the water. Hydrogels can be cleaned and regenerated by soaking in ethanol.

Two vehicle manufacturers recently announced their intentions towards carbon-free steel. Mercedes-Benz has committed to using carbon-free steel from 2025 onwards as part of its commitment to a carbon neutral fleet by 2039. They are achieving this through investment in H2 Green Steel, a green hydrogen powered steel manufacturing plant in Sweden. Volvo is similarly investing in cleaner steel manufacturing, also in Sweden, teaming up with steemaker &%23160;SSAB, replacing coking coal with fossil free electricity and hydrogen. BMW Group has recently signed a contract with German firm Salzgitter for carbon-free steel to use in its European plants from 2026 onwards. The steel will be produced through a mixture of renewable energy and hydrogen. In Canada a mining company has just outlined its plans to develop the World’s first all electric lithium mine, which will provide raw material for the electric vehicle (EV) industry. Snow Lake Lithium Ltd is looking to provide lithium for battery construction to the automotive industry with 100 per cent renewable energy, but there are few details currently on how exactly it will achieve this. A growth in demand from other car manufacturers and indeed other sectors could lead to a significant de-carbonisation of steel making over the coming years.

The plant in question is Shell's Quest plant its Scotford refinery in Alberta, Canada, which produces hydrogen from processing oil sand bitumen. A recent study of the plant from human rights organisation Global Witness suggests that the plant has prevented 5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) from entering the atmosphere since 2015. However at the same time it has generated 7.5 million tonnes of other greenhouse gases, including methane which has a higher global warming impact than CO2. This means that only 48 per cent of emissions were captured, well below the 90 per cent stated by the operators. Global Witness expect their report to present a challenge to further CCS activity. However Shell maintain that the report’s conclusions are incorrect. This all suggests that further research may be needed to ensure that CCS is an appropriate technology to employ alongside fossil fuel refining. The Environment Agency and partners may therefore need to conduct further investigations to ensure that any regulated activities using these processes properly contribute to reducing climate change impacts. This may become more pertinent as the UK pivots towards fossil fuel derived alternative energies such as blue hydrogen.</p>",<p>https&%2358;//interestingengineering.com/shells-carbon-capture-plant-creates-more-emissions-than-it-captures</p>,<p>Shell’s carbon capture plant creates more emissions than it captures</p>,Interesting Engineering,31/01/2022,"Ozdemir, D",,industry2,oil refining,,climate,,1 - operational work,1 - realised,3 - less credible,<p>energy oil hydrogen &quot;carbon capture and storage&quot; CCS Shell Canada Alberta&%23160;Scotford refinery Quest regulation &quot;carbon dioxide&quot; &quot;climate change&quot; &quot;greenhouse gas&quot; CO2 hydrogen &quot;blue hydrogen&quot; &quot;net zero&quot; &quot;Global Witness&quot;</p>,No,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],18/05/2022 11:46,"Loveday, Tim",14/03/2022 10:11,"Dinsdale, Jason",0,,,,,Jason Dinsdale

A new study has concluded that the Earth has now passed the planetary boundary for chemical pollution. This makes it the fifth such planetary boundary to have been crossed. The study concluded this through a combination of measurements, such as the rate of production of chemicals, which is rising rapidly, and their release into the environment, which is happening faster than the ability of authorities to track or investigate any impacts. The researchers suggest that stronger regulation, plus a move towards a circular economy would be two ways with which to mitigate the situation. However one commentator suggests that more research is also needed into detection and impacts due to existing uncertainties on the range of effects from chemical pollution.

A recent systematic study of judicial decisions from the European Court of Human Rights employed Natural Language Processing to analyse the data for patterns in terms of outcomes on whether there has been a violation of an article of the convention of human rights. Following this analysis a model was developed that could predict the outcome of court decisions on these cases with an accuracy of 79 per cent. The research revealed that formal facts of a case were the most important predictive factor, just as in cases involving human judgement, suggesting that further development of the model could aid judicial decision making. A similar system employing AI technology has been developed in China with a reported accuracy of 97 per cent. The system can identify 'dissent' against the state and suggest sentences for supposed criminals, removing people from the prosecution process. The algorithm bases decisions on a training set of 17,000 real life cases and can run on a standard desktop computer. &%23160;It has been tested by the Shanghai Pudong People's Procuratorate, the biggest and busiest district prosecution office in China. The system could allow human prosecutors to focus on more complex cases, representing an efficiency saving. However there are concerns that such a system could remove humans from the decision process altogether. It also may not take account of changing social factors, nor bias in the training data, which may in turn lead to poor decision making. AI presents huge potential benefits to legal procedure, however the Environment Agency may need to ensure that all ethical concerns are properly addressed before it becomes an operational tool in legal proceedings.

Cryptocurrency appeals have financed military hardware, cyber operations and a facial recognition app to identify people in Ukraine thought to be working for Russia. Cryptocurrencies so far represent a small percentage of the donations received. However unlike fiat currency transitions cryptocurrency accounts operated outside of the financial system. There is also a degree of anonymity, making it difficult to identify supporters or their motives. A cryptocurrency based start up in the USA called Ryval has developed a crowdfunding platform to finance lawsuits. Donors contribute to the plaintiff's legal fees. If the lawsuit is successful then the platform converts any compensation awarded into a share for the crowdfunders. Ryval’s founders say that their platform will use gamification to help make the legal system more accessible and affordable to people.

15194,18/02/2022,Jason Dinsdale,"<p>New innovations suggest ways that could be adapted to mitigate water resource shortages at a domestic scale, leading to improved water efficiency.&%23160;</p>","<p>As a regulator of water resources and responder to drought based incidents the Environment Agency may be interested to consider how such new technologies could be strategically deployed to address water resource issues. A recent white paper entitled ‘Water-Energy-Carbon Nexus in our homes. A blind spot for climate crisis?’ found that 90 per cent of energy consumed and 80 per cent of the carbon produced in the water treatment cycle is consumed during domestic water heating. The report also advocates for the ‘50 litre home’, where a combination of technologies and behaviours limits per capita water use to sustainable levels, saving water, and lowering energy use and carbon emissions. One of the innovations coming to light that suggests a technological solution is a compact water recycling system designed for domestic use. Hydraloop is a slim wardrobe sized system installed in the home that collects greywater from baths, showers, hand basins, washing machines, and air conditioning units, which it then disinfects and cleans for reuse in other domestic settings such as toilet flushing, washing machines and garden watering. The chemical and filter free cleaning process involves a six-step purification process of UV light disinfection, enforced skimming aerobic bioreactor, flotation, dissolved air flotation, and sedimentation. A Hydraloop system can reputedly cut water domestic water consumption by 45 per cent. Researchers in Toruń, Poland have developed a similar solution in the form of what they claim is the World’s first no-energy no-pressure water purification and desalination system, called NanoseenX. NanoseenX is primarily designed with providing drinking water and prevent disease in the developing world. It consists of a large cylinder which contains several nanomembranes which progressively filter out a range of contaminants under gravitational force, including salts, microplastics and nanoplastics, bacteria, viruses and light and heavy metal ions. NanoseenX can produce clean water in two minutes and could process 1000 litres per day for the cost of $0.50. Crucially NanoseenX can be installed in any climate or location and doesn’t require electricity to work. While the technology here has a specific purpose in mind, application of the same principles in more developed countries could similarly assist with the energy, carbon and resource costs of conventional water treatment, while also contributing to the idea of domestic water independence and reducing piped water supply demands. This may also present a challenge to current water supply business models.</p>",<p>https&%2358;//www.thefirstnews.com/article/torun-scientists-create-worlds-first-no-energy-no-pressure-water-purification-and-desalination-solution-to-help-fight-global-drinking-water-shortages-27413</p>,<p>Toruń scientists create world’s first no-energy no-pressure water purification and desalination solution to help fight global drinking water shortages</p>,The First News,21/01/2022,"Konopka, B","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.intelligentliving.co/hydraloop-water-recycling-system/"">Reuse Your Grey Water Easily With This Compact Hydraloop Water Recycling System (intelligentliving.co)</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.forbes.com/sites/jennifercastenson/2022/01/04/housing-beware-water-scarcity-is-only-the-surface-of-the-issue/?sh=463be01028f8"">Housing Beware&%2358; Water Scarcity Is Only The Surface Of The Issue (forbes.com)</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//50lhome.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/The-Arcadis-50L-Home-White-Paper_111621.pdf"">The-Arcadis-50L-Home-White-Paper_111621.pdf (50lhome.org)</a></p>",water1,waste water reduction,,water2,,1 - operational work,3 - some development needed,3 - less credible,<p>&quot;water resources&quot; &quot;water quality&quot; &quot;water demand&quot; domestic household water supply Hydraloop NanoseenX filter membrane nanomembrane microplastic nanoplastic&%23160;UV light disinfection&%23160;aerobic bioreactor&%23160;flotation&%23160;dissolved air flotation sedimentation energy carbon &quot;climate change&quot; water reuse &quot;grey water&quot; toilet flush baths&%23160;shower&%23160;&quot;washing machine&quot;&%23160;&quot;air conditioning&quot; salt bacteria &quot;heavy metal&quot; ion virus regulation &quot;water independence&quot; &quot;50 litre home&quot; &quot;50L home&quot;</p>,No,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],18/05/2022 11:46,"Loveday, Tim",18/02/2022 11:17,"Dinsdale, Jason",0,,,,,Jason Dinsdale

In addition, block chain technology is power hungry and large scale adoption of Web 3 could lead to additional carbon emissions. Currently the idea is still in its infancy and defining what Web 3 will do is difficult and will depend on how users engage with the technology. In an idealistic view it offers individual control to the user, preventing data harvesting and government control. Block chain works by storing encrypted chunks of data in a ledger spread across many connected nodes. When a node is full it is ‘closed’ and linked directly to the previous node creating an un-editable time stamp. Encrypting the data means only the data owner can access it and spreading the data between nodes means hacking is virtually impossible. Block chain removes the need for server centres which are housed in one place making them vulnerable to incidents such as fires.

The device can also flag up any technical issues that occur and respond to events such as flooding automatically. Combined with being solar powered, this device offers a cost effective alternative to current methods. A new airborne methane sensor deployed by NASA, found that California landfills have been leaking methane at rates as much as six times greater than estimates from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

New research focussing on the US state of California suggests that future residents may lose air conditioning for one week each summer as energy demand for air conditioning cooling will exceed that of the entire grid supply. Such an occurrence would have a range of consequences for food preservation, healthcare and others. Increasing energy production could alleviate this issue, but may be counterproductive if not based on clean renewable energy sources. While the UK has a very different climate to California, the notion of hotter, drier summers creating greater demand for artificial cooling is in line with current projections of climate change impacts. Offering the building blocks of a potential solution is a low-cost, electricity free cooling system developed in Saudi Arabia. Peng Wang’s system draws on the cooling effect generated when salt crystals are dissolved in water. Having tested numerous salts, Wang and team found that ammonium nitrate offered the right balance of solubility, cooling effect and price. By melting the salt slowly in a metal cup in a polystyrene box Wang and team managed to produce a cooling effect down to 3.6 degrees celsius. The salt was then recovered by placing the saline solution in a container made of absorbent material, which drew the salt to the exterior. While still in early stages Wang and team are looking to develop their process into a cooling system for use in medicine, food storage and air conditioning, particularly in remote areas away from the grid.

The amount required to heat an average UK home is 100W/m2. Unlike ground source heat pumps, minimal excavation is required. This technology could only provide heat to coastal locations but with the UK having a large coastline it would be a good candidate for trials. If proven successful, this could be incorporated into sustainable urban designs in coastal areas as an alternative to ground source heat pumps. A pilot study in Qingdau, China laid 250m2 of 4.3mm capillary tubes on the seabed at 5m depth and found the water exiting the seabed was 40.6C. The water was then pumped 300m to a hotel where an indoor heat exchanger was used to warm the air. Similar principles can be used to provide cooling power.

15173,28/01/2022,Jason Dinsdale,"<p>As the UK Government unveils plans to pay farmers for rewilding areas of their land, new initiatives are coming to light that demonstrate the rewilding potential of publicly owned land in urban environments.</p>","<p>The Environment Agency should be mindful of the opportunities that growing interest in urban rewilding could present in achieving some of its own strategic objectives such as natural realignment of rivers and flood management. Though levels of funding and final scale have yet to be disclosed the UK Government is to run 10-15 pilot projects focussed on landscape recovery. There are also plans to pay farmers to focus on local nature recovery. In total such schemes could cover a land area the size of Lancashire by 2042. One criticism of the scheme has been that encouraging rewilding in this way may be vulnerable to changing market prices for crops and other agricultural products, either leading to waning impact or food shortages. At the same time there are other signals pointing towards greater rewilding of more urban land, some of which is publicly owned. Naturalist and campaigner Chris Packham has met with the Crown Estate to discuss the prospect of rewilding aspects of its holdings, which includes farmland, woodlands and uplands, but also urban areas such as Regent Street in central London and Windsor Great Park. A recent study of London’s publicly owned golf courses established a case that their combined land area (equivalent to the borough of Brent) could become more accessible to residents through including biodiverse green space, amongst other uses. Derby city council recently approved the UK’s largest urban rewilding project for Allestree Park, the city’s largest urban green space. Ideas for rewilding the park include new habitat creation, community orchards reintroducing key species, such as water vole and harvest mouse. This project and others mentioned could inspire other publicly owned and urban spaces to follow suit, bringing environmental benefits in terms of mitigating climate change impacts, carbon sequestration, and water quality benefits through fewer chemical and fertiliser applications. Such schemes could also provide ‘blue space’ benefits, including natural realignment of rivers and natural flood management such as providing areas for flood water storage. The Environment Agency may wish to ensure that it is proactively advising and influencing urban rewilding schemes to maximise the benefits to its own strategic objectives and interest in urban rewilding grows.</p>",<p>https&%2358;//www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/11/derby-approves-uk-largest-urban-rewilding-project-aoe</p>,<p>‘Natural Health Service’&%2358; Derby approves UK’s largest urban rewilding project</p>,The Guardian,11/11/2021,"Green, G","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/06/englands-farmers-to-be-paid-to-rewild-land"">England’s farmers to be paid to rewild land | Farming | The Guardian</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10383529/Governments-rewilding-scheme-lead-big-increase-food-prices.html"">Government's rewilding scheme will lead to 'big increase' in food prices | Daily Mail Online</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/16/chris-packham-meets-crown-estate-to-promote-rewilding-royal-land"">Chris Packham meets crown estate to promote rewilding royal land | Land ownership | The Guardian</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/aug/26/london-golf-courses-could-provide-homes-for-300000-people-study-says"">London golf courses could provide homes for 300,000 people, study says | Planning policy | The Guardian</a></p><p>&%23160;</p>","urban environment, urban stress",landscape utilisation,,biology1,urban biodiversity,3 - influencing role,1 - realised,2 - credible,<p>landscape land use biodiversity conservation habitat recreation rewilding farming agriculture payment farmer UK Government 2042 Lancashire vole mouse nature urban &quot;Chris Packham&quot; &quot;Crown Estate&quot; &quot;Regent Street&quot; &quot;Windsor Great Park&quot; Brent London golf &quot;golf course&quot; garden allotment housing &quot;green space&quot; &quot;blue space&quot; Derby Allestree Park flood &quot;water quality&quot; chemical fertiliser river town city crop food economic market cost price</p>,No,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],18/05/2022 11:46,"Loveday, Tim",28/01/2022 10:57,"Dinsdale, Jason",0,,,,,Jason Dinsdale

Kocak sees this as being particularly important during winter when his cattle spend more time indoors. Initial results seem promising in terms of raising milk yields. However the experiment’s success raises a number of issues around the ethics of animal treatment. Creating an optimised virtual environment that leads to contented cows and higher yields might weaken the ethical case for not pursuing intensive dairy and livestock farming. This in turn could mean a greater regulatory role for the Environment Agency. This could also contribute to wider scale land use change away from dairy farming.

15164,18/01/2022,Jason Dinsdale,<p>Several projects have been investigating the viability of recovering ammonia from wastewater and agricultural waste for use in energy production.</p>,"<p>The Environment Agency should be interested in this development as ammonia is considered a problematic emission from some regulated settings such as pig and poultry installations. Researchers based at Delft University of Technology have recovered a gaseous ammonia-water mixture from wastewater using membrane stripping, which was used to power a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC). Even with relatively low ammonia concentrations the set up recovered more energy than it consumed, suggesting commercially viable ammonia recovery &amp; use from wastewater feeds. A UK based research consortium, partly funded by Defra, are similarly investigating the potential of harvesting green ammonia from pig waste. Previous research using similar methods with digestate from wastewater treatment plants suggested 82 per cent of ammonia could be recovered that would otherwise require energy intensive processes to destroy. Ukrainian researchers have been making similar in-roads using poultry waste as a feedstock. They were able to extract ammonia and biogas from anaerobic digestion of poultry waste through carefully controlling ammonium levels in the digester. Producing ammonia in this way was found to be more energy intensive than the Haber Bosch process conventionally used for industrial scale ammonia production, but this could be mitigated through scaling this process up at poultry farms, adding co generation facilities and utilising waste heat from biogas combustion. Poultry waste has the highest nitrogen content of livestock waste and potentially 8 million tonnes of ammonia per year could be generated in both the US and the EU via this anaerobic digestion process. Recent research estimates that 60 per cent of particulate air pollution (PM2.5) in the UK originates as ammonia emissions from farms, and that the introduction of simple mitigation methods could save £23 in health damage for every £1 spent in the UK. The advent of these technologies could provide mechanisms to reduce fossil fuel dependency and improve air quality, however their introduction may fall under similar regulatory requirements as anaerobic digestion and therefore require Environment Agency roles and resources.</p>",<p>https&%2358;//www.ammoniaenergy.org/articles/recovering-ammonia-fuel-from-wastewater-agricultural-waste/</p>,<p>Recovering ammonia fuel from wastewater &amp; agricultural waste</p>,Ammonia Energy,08/12/2021,"Atchison, J","<p dir=""ltr""><a href=""https&%2358;//www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1385894721026632"">Fuelling a solid oxide fuel cell with ammonia recovered from water by vacuum membrane stripping - ScienceDirect</a></p><p dir=""ltr""><a href=""https&%2358;//ahdb.org.uk/news/pigprogram-research-project-awarded-funding-by-defra-ukri"">PigProGrAm project funding awarded by UK Govt. | AHDB</a></p><p dir=""ltr""><a href=""http&%2358;//journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/view/243068?fbclid=IwAR0Y6eu6dY-gSv7DRyJSI1uyuWc9B155jEL7MrhxOxrOMjP2IblRydp7A1I"">Development of an ammonia production method for carbon-free energy generation | Eastern-European Journal of Enterprise Technologies (uran.ua)</a></p><p dir=""ltr""><a href=""https&%2358;//www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/04/ammonia-from-farms-behind-60-of-uk-particulate-air-pollution-study"">Ammonia from farms behind 60% of UK particulate air pollution – study | Air pollution | The Guardian</a></p>",energy,agricultural bioenergy production,,water1,biological waste water treatment,1 - operational work,3 - some development needed,2 - credible,<p>energy waste ammonia hydrogen pig poultry regulation emission air quality particulate matter PM2.5 Ukraine Defra &quot;Delft University of Technology&quot; &quot;solid oxide fuel cell&quot; SOFC wastewater treatment &quot;waste water&quot; membrane &quot;Haber Bosch&quot; &quot;anaerobic digestion&quot; biogas ammonium US UK farming agriculture</p>,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],18/05/2022 11:46,"Loveday, Tim",18/01/2022 14:44,"Dinsdale, Jason",0,,,,,Jason Dinsdale

Gorse is an important habitat for insects and birds, but it can spread quickly to choke out other plants and is therefore seen as invasive. It is particularly problematic in some areas of Scotland where there is a concerted effort to prevent it colonising valuable agricultural land. Livestock and fodder production occupies 83% of the world’s farmland but produces only 18% of protein. Gorse has historically been used as livestock feed on the occasions when other crops have failed. Recent research looking at the protein content of invasive plants found that gorse contains 17 per cent protein. It’s ability to thrive on marginal land therefore suggests that with further development gorse could become a valuable source of nutrition from marginal land for livestock and potentially even human consumption. Calculations have shown that there is potentially enough gorse protein on marginal land in Scotland to feed its entire population. The carbon footprint of gorse protein is also significantly smaller than that of meat. There is still much to develop - for example it is difficult to gauge the processing needed to extract the protein and how this would compare to gorse fed livestock or livestock in general.&%23160;But with evidence that the population is also more willing to embrace alternative proteins, sources such as gorse could become increasingly important as both a food source and a means of providing biodiversity protection, reducing competing pressures on land use.</p>",<p>https&%2358;//www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/10/protein-from-gorse-bushes-could-feed-millions-of-people-says-expert</p>,"<p>Protein from gorse bushes could feed millions of people, says expert</p>",The Guardian,10/01/2022,"Carrington, D",,agriculture,meat,,"natural areas, landscape, ecosystems",,1 - operational work,3 - some development needed,2 - credible,<p>farming agriculture conservation biodiversity meat livestock protein plant gorse invasive &quot;land use&quot; flooding food regulation habitat insect bird regulation human &quot;climate change&quot; &quot;carbon footprint&quot;</p>,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],18/05/2022 11:46,"Loveday, Tim",14/01/2022 12:33,"Dinsdale, Jason",0,,,,,Jason Dinsdale
15162,12/01/2022,Jason Dinsdale,<p>In the wake of mounting evidence scientists are beginning to reconsider if insects are capable of experiencing and expressing emotions.</p>,"<p>Research suggests that insects can experience a range of states akin to delight, depression, and fright just like other animals might do. Emotions can be framed as mental programmes that change our behaviour in certain situations. In evolutionary terms these help us survive. It is possible that insects experience similar ‘programmes’ for the same reasons. Experiments involving fruit flies and bees demonstrate that they can experience hunger and trauma respectively. And a colour change response in the golden tortoise beetle to stress has been shown to be a consciously controlled action rather than a passive reaction. There’s also mounting evidence that insects can feel depression and long term pain, changing their behaviour to prevent an injury happening again. Currently insects experience a significant level of systematic destruction - it’s believed that 3.5 quadrillion insects a year are killed with pesticides per year on US farmland alone - to the point where the World is experiencing an ‘insect Armageddon’. Knowing that insects can experience complex feelings and emotions could reframe the way in which humans view the impacts of agricultural practices. This could include the emerging field of farming insect protein for livestock and human consumption. The existence of insect emotions also raises ethical questions for research programmes, just as it has previously for other living things.

New Zealand is to introduce a blanket ban on cigarette sales to young people under the age of 14. The ban will come into force in 2027. Anyone aged 15 in 2027 will still be able to buy tobacco once they reach the age of 18. Anyone 14 and younger will be banned for the rest of their lives. This is because the evidence suggests that lifetime smoking habits become established during early teenage years. One reason the law is being introduced is to tackle the disproportionate impacts of smoking on the health of the indigenous Maori community. The law is being phased in to lessen the economic shocks &%23160;on retailers and give people with mental health issues - a group with far higher smoking rates - time to manage the change. It isn’t yet clear how the law will be policed effectively. The law could be approved in 2022. The existence of this proposed law suggests that other similar demographically based laws could be introduced for environmental improvements, such as personal resource budgets (e.g. water, carbon, meat). A younger more environmentally conscious electorate could be more receptive to such lifestyle changes than older members of the population, allowing for policy makers to ‘kickstart’ longer term changes without encountering political and social blockers in the present day.</p>",<p>https&%2358;//www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/how-will-new-zealands-lifetime-ban-cigarette-sales-work-2021-12-09/</p>,<p>Explainer&%2358; How will New Zealand's lifetime ban on cigarette sales work?</p>,Reuters,09/12/2021,,,human health,smoke prevention,,"social aspects, population",,1 - operational work,2 - near to realisation,2 - credible,<p>health behaviour law legislation smoking regulation demographic &quot;New Zealand&quot; 2027 tobacco &quot;climate change&quot; resource water waste Maori</p>,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],18/05/2022 11:46,"Loveday, Tim",12/01/2022 14:57,"Dinsdale, Jason",0,,,,,Jason Dinsdale

An ionomer is a polymer composed of repeat units of both electrically neutral repeating units and ionised units covalently bonded to the polymer backbone as pendant group moieties. Commercial applications include golf ball covers, sealing tape, thermoplastic elastomers, and of interest to PFAS removal, semipermeable membranes. Conventional carbon filtration systems are only able to filter out“long-chain” PFAS. The ionomers are able to filter out “short-chain” PFAS chemicals. The Centre is also working on technology that could destroy PFAS from contaminated well water in situ - currently PFAS contamination needs to be transported to incinerators. These technological developments should be of interest to the Environment Agency in its regulatory activities with water, chemical and waste sectors as they could offer the possibility to reduce pollution from operational sites.

Existing passive atmospheric water harvesting systems effectively collect dew and so can only function at night when the collected water is not evaporated by the sun. The researchers have developed a technology that enables 24 hour passive water harvesting, even under i blazing sunlight. A special glass pane coated with silver and polymer, which both reflects solar radiation and also radiates away its own heat through the atmosphere cools itself down to as much as 15 degrees Celsius below ambient temperature. A cone shaped radiation shield also protects the glass pane from incoming solar radiation and aids passive self-cooling. Water vapour condenses on the underside of the glass, which has a super-hydrophobic coating, causing the water to run down and gather in the collector without the need for wiping mechanisms. The current technology is at a model stage but could easily be scaled up to produce a 0.53 decilitres of water per square metre of pane surface per hour - close to the theoretical maximum value of 0.6 decilitres per hour. The future could see several modules working side by side in a similar arrangement to how solar farms function and could also be combined alongside desalination installations. The technology was designed with water scarcity issues, particularly in developing countries in mind.

The marine environment is known to offer potential to store ‘blue carbon’ through coastal and marine habitats such as mangroves, seagrasses and tidal marshes (%2310740). This new discovery offers another potential ‘non-tech’ solution to carbon storage in contrast to technology led carbon capture solutions. Great whales were found to sequester 33 tons of CO2 on average, accumulated over their lifetimes, taking the carbon out of the atmosphere for centuries. A tree only absorbs up to 48 pounds of CO2 a year. Historic commercial whaling significantly reduced whale populations, with today’s numbers representing a quarter of overall numbers, but as low as three per cent for blue whales. Protecting whales to increase their numbers could therefore deliver significant carbon capture benefits. Whale waste is rich in nutrients iron and nitrogen, which stimulates phytoplankton growth, as does the ‘whale pump’ of nutrients that they bring to the surface through their vertical movement in the water column. Phytoplankton currently absorb 40 per cent of the World’s carbon dioxide, and therefore show further potential for carbon capture. Even a one per cent increase in phytoplankton productivity from whale activity could capture the equivalent to the sudden appearance of 2 billion mature trees per year. Conservation efforts to increase whale numbers would need funding. However, allowing whale populations to recover to pre-whaling levels would cost $13 per person a year to subsidise, capturing 1.7 billion tons of CO2 annually.

15146,01/12/2021,Jason Dinsdale,<p>Advertising and media companies are becoming more active in shaping public opinion towards action on climate change.</p>,"<p>This should be of interest to the Environment Agency and partners as changing attitudes to the environment may also impact on public opinion towards organisations working in the environmental field. There may also be some lessons to learn in persuasive communications around environmental issues. Several surveys conducted recently paint a mixed picture as to the public’s attitudes and behaviours towards climate change. The Global Consumer Barometer Study suggests that nearly three quarters of UK consumers believe that the responsibility for action on the environment was down to governments. However, 61% said companies must take the lead and 60% said driving change is down to individual behaviour and responsibility. A different global survey, which included subjects from the UK found that most people believe that they are already doing as much as they could to address environmental issues, with few willing to rate measures that impacted their own lifestyles as important. Another survey from the World Economic Forum also revealed that there has been a global decline in people practicing climate-conscious lifestyles since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. Fewer than one-in-five people are changing their lives significantly for reasons of climate, and a third making no changes at all. Against this backdrop of attitudes to climate action are initiatives from the media sector to encourage more environmentally sustainable choices. Leaders at the Advertising Association’s Ad Net Zero summit recognised that their industry has a role to “change the way people think, feel and act”. Advertising was seen as having a role in helping to fill information gaps with accurate information and ensuring advertisements do not appear beside articles that contradict scientific evidence. The broadcaster Sky recently worked with the Behavioural Insights Team (BIT) across several European countries. Their research demonstrated that four-fifths of people across Europe support the idea of broadcasters using content and advertising to encourage people to adopt more environmentally positive behaviours. Sky and BIT have published a report outlining ten new behavioural science principles to guide broadcasters on helping their viewers to take action. The Environment Agency may need to consider how an emerging willingness to approach environmental issues from the media industry could provide opportunities for communications to help it achieve environmental objectives.</p>",<p>https&%2358;//www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/cop26-next-big-frontier-climate-battle-changing-consumer-habits-ad-chiefs-say/1732194</p>,"<p>COP26&%2358; ‘Next big frontier’ in climate battle is changing consumer habits, ad chiefs say</p>",Campaign,03/11/2021,"Merrifield, N","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//internetretailing.net/themes/shoppers-most-concerned-about-environment-and-drop-brands-that-arent-study-23878"">Shoppers most concerned about environment and drop brands that aren’t&%2358; study - InternetRetailing</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/07/few-willing-to-change-lifestyle-climate-survey"">Few willing to change lifestyle to save the planet, climate survey finds | Environment | The Guardian</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.thelondoneconomic.com/news/consumers-climate-mindful-lifestyles-poll-301211/"">Fewer people are living climate-conscious lives since Covid (thelondoneconomic.com)</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.rapidtvnews.com/2021110261500/sky-behaviour-change-on-climate-can-be-driven-by-tv.html"">Sky&%2358; behaviour change on climate can be driven by TV | Media Analysis | Business | News | Rapid TV News</a></p>",climate,climatic change,,information,,1 - operational work,2 - near to realisation,2 - credible,<p>&quot;climate change&quot; behaviour public communication advertising media broadcaster Sky &quot;Behavioural Insights Team&quot; BIT lifestyle Covid pandemic coronavirus&%23160;</p>,No,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],18/05/2022 11:46,"Loveday, Tim",01/12/2021 11:41,"Dinsdale, Jason",0,,,,,Jason Dinsdale

Scientists took an isolated bacterium which had been found effective at breaking down ammonium. Acidimicrobiaceae sp. A6 (A6) is unusual in that it can break down ammonium using iron present in soil. This reaction is known as Feammox. The scientists wondered if the same principle could be applied to PFAS. &%23160;They grew cultures of A6 in iron rich mediums, into which were added perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) or perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS). They found that A6 used the Feammox reaction to transfer electrons from ammonium or hydrogen gas to PFAS, removing the fluoride atoms and rendering the substances harmless. The microbes degraded up to 60% of the PFOA and 50% of the PFOS over a 100 day period.

The Georgia Tech developed robot recognises and removes undeveloped peaches known as peachlets. It can also assist with pruning, selectively removing branches prior to the spring growing season. Robots have yet to replace humans entirely, due to the nature of unstructured environments, which includes unpredictable weather, uneven terrain, and trees' different shapes and sizes. Further development however could lead to significant disruptions to farming and horticulture. IN another development an Australian company has recently won a multi-home construction contract, which it will fulfil using Hadrian X, its bricklaying robot. This is the first multi-home contract for Perth based FBR to build eight two storey houses using its Wall as a Service (WaaS) construction system. Similar systems have been seen previously (12943, %2312865). Bricklaying robot Hadrian X has a top building speed of 200 large blocks per hour, which is the equivalent of 2,200 standard bricks using manual labour.

15142,29/11/2021,Jason Dinsdale,"<p>Further developments in virtual currency and blockchain technology suggest further ways in which digital currency could transform financial systems, yet also demonstrate the potential for such systems to impact negatively on the environment, particularly around energy use and climate change.</p>","<p>Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) &%23160;have recently emerged as a new development in digital currency and assets. An NFT is a digital asset can represent a real-world object, or a completely digital asset. Whereas the key property of digital is that it can be easily copied and replicated an NFT might be a one of a kind digital asset, or be of a limited run. An example could be digital art or a video clip. The NFT confirms who owns that particular digital artefact, though they may not own the rights to it. Crucially NFTs can also be configured so that the original artist automatically retains a percentage of any future sales. NFTs have been around for some time, but their popularity has soared, coinciding with the pandemic. NFTs remain controversial as not everyone believes that the NFT has any intrinsic value next to a physical piece of art. The market is also unregulated - one collector was recently tricked into paying $336,000 for a fake Banksy NFT - the hacker later returned the money, less a transaction fee. &%23160;However NFTs are seen as valuable and collectable by some&%2358; a British 12 year old recently created a series of NFTs called Weird Whales, pocketing £290,000 in the process. Other platforms are emerging with elements of NFTs and blockchain technology behind them, from which it’s possible to earn a living. One such gaming platform is Axie Infinity&%2358; an online, blockchain-based game where players can earn tokens and cash out in local currency. The game involves cultivating in-game creatures called Axies, which can be battled or sold at a profit to other players. The game is popular in the developing World. One player in the Philippines claims to earn $2000 a month from an hour’s play per day. Some teams receive sponsorship from wealthy patrons in the form of an entry stake, looking to profit further down the line. Virtual currencies are also gaining more mainstream interest. The UK Government is launching a consultation on a potential central bank digital currency (CBDC) next year, assessing the case for digital pound and whether to run a development phase. A recent survey of finance industry executives also revealed that the majority of respondents expect digital assets to serve as a strong alternative, or a replacement of fiat currencies within the next five to ten years. Hand in hand with increased interest in the potential of distributed ledgers and blockchain is the environmental impacts, particularly around energy use. China’s recent ban on currency mining has led to many Chinese miners relocating to Kazakhstan, leading to an eight per cent increase in annual energy demand, compared to a normal level of one to two per cent. America is also experiencing an influx of cryptocurrency miners, interested in establishing in old industrial facilities such as former aluminium plants, which already have the infrastructure installed to handle large electricity demands. Activists are concerned that the heat generated from a hydropower plant serving crypto mining in upstate New York is warming a nearby lake. Both the energy and hardware demands of cryptomining are significant, with one recent study equating a single BitCoin transaction generating as much electronic waste as two iPhone 12s. With many potential benefits from digital currencies, and interest from central government, the Environment Agency and partners may have a role in advocating the environmental and resource impacts of these technologies, as well as being mindful of the potential impacts they could bring to energy infrastructure and waste management.</p>",<p>https&%2358;//restofworld.org/2021/axie-infinity/</p>,<p>Workers in the Global South are making a living playing the blockchain game Axie Infinity</p>,Rest Of World,19/08/2021,"Elliot, V","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.forbes.com/uk/advisor/investing/nft-non-fungible-token/"">What Is An NFT?

15141,26/11/2021,Jason Dinsdale,<p>Experiments involving ‘microflyers’ made novel materials may provide ways in which environmental monitoring equipment could be deployed to the mesosphere.</p>,"<p>This may be of interest to the Environment Agency’s research interests in earth observation and monitoring. The mesosphere is between 31 and 53 miles above the Earth. The combination of thin air, yet close proximity to Earth make it unsuitable for deploying either satellites or flying aircraft and balloons. &%23160;Scientists have simulated the mesosphere in experiments in order to test out microflyers which employ a novel method for achieving lift. The microflyers consist of six millimetre wide disk with a top layer of mylar and a bottom layer of a very thin layer of carbon nanotubes. When exposed to bright light the disc heats up. When a molecule in the air comes into contact with it, the disk transfers some of its warmth, making the molecule move faster and push back on the disk. The disks heat up when they are exposed to bright light. Then, when individual air molecules bounce off of a disk, the disk transfers some of its warmth to the molecule, which makes the molecule move a little bit faster. By Newton’s Third Law, which states that every action has an equal and opposite reaction, the air molecule pushes back on the disk, too. Carbon nanotube are comparatively better than mylar at transferring energy in this way, leading to an imbalance in force which translates into upward movement. This experiment has provided sufficient data to calculate that a two inch disk could carry ten milligrams worth of payload, enough to carry small sensing equipment. Further development is needed to ensure the disks are robust enough to endure the harsh conditions of the mesosphere. However their existence creates the prospect of deploying multiple disks to provide new insight on atmospheric processes and potential new approaches to monitoring in harsh environments such as on Mars. Separate research recently suggested that the Earth’s auroras may be contributing to mesospheric ozone layer depletion, a process which has implications for climate change.

The Netherlands previously introduced a ban to prevent building on land contaminated with PFAS. PFAS (Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) derive from cleaning products, fire-fighting foam, fast food packaging and other sources. They have been associated with health complications in fish, animals, drinking water, and humans, such as diseases and autoimmune dysfunctions. PFAS do not break down readily, earning them the label “forever chemicals”. The Netherlands has banned construction development on PFAS contaminated land, effectively reframing the environmental health crisis as a housing crisis. While there are some remediation practices such as washing contaminated sands, but turns land pollution into a water pollution issue. It’s also not suitable for clay. Heating the clay to a high temperature in a process known as Thermal Treatment burns of PFAS, leaving a dead soil. However this can easily be turned into ceramic products such as bricks for a localised market. The process is not at a commercial stage yet but the developers are looking to collaborate with industry to take it to market. The Environment Agency may wish to consider any additional regulatory processes needed for PFAS thermal treatment activities. It may also wish to consider if PFAS clean bricks could be incorporated into its own construction and asset management activities as a way to reduce their environmental impacts.&%23160;</p>",<p>https&%2358;//www.designindaba.com/articles/creative-work/no-waste-challenge-winner-packing-pfas-creates-clean-bricks-polluted-clay</p>,"<p>No Waste Challenge winner, Packing Up PFAS creates clean bricks from polluted clay</p>",Design Indaba,21/09/2021,"Bensdorp, E",,industry1,construction with recycled material,,pollution1,,1 - operational work,2 - near to realisation,2 - credible,<p>regulation construction pollution pollutant chemical chemistry PFAS &quot;Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances&quot; clay land Netherland Holland brick &quot;Thermal Treatment&quot; water sand clay health&%23160;disease&%23160;&%23160;&quot;autoimmune dysfunction&quot; wildlife</p>,No,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],18/05/2022 11:46,"Loveday, Tim",17/11/2021 15:17,"Dinsdale, Jason",0,,,,,Jason Dinsdale

Currently, technological innovations concentrate around human needs which automatically come at an ecological cost whereas to shape future for a more sustainable way of life it is necessary for researchers to us consider developing systems that influence users to sustainability. Posthuman approach makes researchers and designers rethink their relationship and to train themselves to notice things differently.

15133,27/08/2021,Jason Dinsdale,<p>The chair of the UK Hydrogen &amp; Fuel Cell Association (UK HFCA) has resigned over controversy around the environmental impacts of blue hydrogen.&%23160;</p>,"<p>The Environment Agency works in the regulatory space that technologies such as blue hydrogen occupy, and therefore should be interested in the changing nature of nascent energy technologies. &%23160;Blue hydrogen is formed through extraction from methane gas. It produces carbon dioxide as a by-product, and so therefore depends on carbon capture and storage to a low impact energy. Chris Jackson, who is also the CEO a green hydrogen and fuel cell project developer Protium Green Solutions, stood down over what is reported to be his inability to support blue hydrogen due to its dependence on fossil fuels, namely gas, as a feedstock. Jackson states that reliance on blue hydrogen delays meeting decarbonisation goals. There is also some CO2 leakage of around five per cent associated with blue hydrogen, compared to green hydrogen produced from renewably powered electrolysis which produces zero CO2 during production. Jackson also acknowledges green hydrogen isn’t a ‘silver bullet’ and that other energy pathways are needed. Jackson has also claimed that oil companies have made false claims to the government over the true costs of blue hydrogen production, which if true, would mean that the subsidies currently being offered by the Treasury would be unnecessary in order to be profitable in a relatively short timescale. &%23160;Commentary on the Government’s hydrogen strategy elsewhere highlight that the estimated future costs of production are notably dissimilar to estimates from the EU and the USA. Green hydrogen is seen as becoming more expensive to produce than blue hydrogen, whereas the reverse is seen elsewhere. The commentator also notes that even if the UK’s estimates of green hydrogen prices do come to pass then it would make economic sense to import hydrogen gas from elsewhere, rather than build production in the UK. Moving the focus away from hydrogen the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) recently published new estimates of levelised costs of electricity (LCOE), which are the average cost of electricity, per megawatt hour (MWh) generated, across the lifetime of a new power plant. The estimated costs of solar and wind in particular have fallen dramatically since the last published estimates. In 2013, offshore wind was estimated to generate electricity for £140/MWh by 2025. A 2016 revision brought this down by 24%, to £107/MWh. The latest estimate puts the cost at just £57/MWh, another 47% reduction. Similar trajectories are reported for onshore wind and solar, with levelised costs in 2025 now thought to be some 50% lower than expected by the 2013 government report. There is the possibility that costs may follow the same trajectory, becoming even cheaper by 2025, well below the estimated costs for both green and blue hydrogen. This uncertainty over economic viability and environmental impacts may in turn impact on the Environment Agency’s strategic planning for regulatory activities. Further investigation of these may therefore be required to ensure more resilient forward planning. There is also reputational risk if the Environment Agency is perceived to be supporting activities which are more expensive and damaging than cleaner alternatives.</p>",<p>https&%2358;//www.rechargenews.com/energy-transition/betraying-future-generations-chair-of-uk-hydrogen-group-quits-over-blue-h2-support/2-1-1054960</p>,<p>'Betraying future generations'&%2358; chair of UK hydrogen group quits over blue H2 support</p>,Recharge,19/08/2021,"Radowitz, B","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/20/oil-firms-made-false-claims-on-blue-hydrogen-costs-says-ex-lobby-boss"">Oil firms made ‘false claims’ on blue hydrogen costs, says ex-lobby boss | Hydrogen power | The Guardian</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.carboncommentary.com/blog/2021/8/18/ht84sm6i17we0drv929w39o1pgn23m"">The delusions of the UK hydrogen strategy | Carbon Commentary</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.carbonbrief.org/wind-and-solar-are-30-50-cheaper-than-thought-admits-uk-government"">Wind and solar are 30-50% cheaper than thought, admits UK government (carbonbrief.org)</a></p>",energy,renewable energy,renewable energy source,economics1,,1 - operational work,3 - some development needed,2 - credible,<p>energy renewable hydrogen &quot;green hydrogen&quot; &quot;blue hydrogen&quot; solar wind cost &quot;climate change&quot; emission &quot;carbon dioxide&quot; CO2 UK Government Treasury BEIS EU USA &quot;levelised costs of electricity&quot; LCOE &quot;Chris Jackson&quot; chair &quot;UK Hydrogen &amp; Fuel Cell Association&quot; &quot;UK HFCA&quot; HFCA &quot;Protium Green Solutions&quot; electricity power plant regulation electrolysis</p>,No,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],18/05/2022 11:46,"Loveday, Tim",27/08/2021 11:20,"Dinsdale, Jason",0,,,,,Jason Dinsdale

Tree DNA has recently been used for the first time in conjunction with federal crime proceedings in the USA. DNA analysis of lumber sold to a sawmill in Washington state proved that it matched the stumps of three bigleaf maple trees that were discovered to have been illegally logged from protected national forest. Ultimately the accused persons were being charged with illegally starting a forest fire, rather than illegal logging - the jury found them not guilty. Having failed to tackle the issue of dog fouling with increasing fines the city council in Tel Aviv, Israel, has approved setting up a DNA database for pet dogs. Owners will be obliged to submit DNA samples of their pets when they renew their dog owner’s licence (guide dogs and animal protection agencies are exempt). The data will be used in conjunction with prosecuting owners not clearing up their dog’s poo. Operatives will test DNA in the streets, sending fines to owners automatically (it’s not clear if the testing itself takes place in the street or in a laboratory). Technologies have, and are being, developed that would allow for DNA testing and identification to happen in the field without the need for laboratory analysis (%2313489, %2312709, %2312535), suggesting that DNA sampling and processing could become an increasingly important tool for environmental enforcement, the applications of which the Environment Agency may wish to consider.</p>",<p>https&%2358;//www.timesofisrael.com/tel-aviv-will-test-dog-poop-dna-to-fine-owners-who-dont-clean-up/</p>,<p>Tel Aviv will test dog poop DNA to fine owners who don’t clean up</p>,Times Of Israel,13/07/2021,,"<p><a href=""https&%2358;//apnews.com/article/business-science-fires-environment-and-nature-trees-0a6cbe1f39380531fc367b033481f261"">Tree DNA helps convict Washington timber thief after fire (apnews.com)</a></p>",legislation,environmental regulation,,environmental policy1,environmental monitoring,1 - operational work,1 - realised,2 - credible,<p>monitoring &quot;environmental monitoring&quot; prosecution regulation legislation data DNA test laboratory timber wood lumber Washington USA &quot;bigleaf maple&quot; fire law crime &quot;Tel Aviv&quot; dog poo pet licence owner data database fine eDNA &quot;water quality&quot; biology biological</p>,No,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],18/05/2022 11:46,"Loveday, Tim",26/08/2021 10:36,"Dinsdale, Jason",0,,,,,Jason Dinsdale

15130,25/08/2021,Jason Dinsdale,<p>Putting evidence at the heart of environmental decision making &%23160;may become more difficult due to transfer of knowledge from physical to digital mediums.&%23160;</p>,"<p>This has implications for all evidence based organisations, including the Environment Agency. &%23160;A recent article from the Atlantic illustrates how moving to digital media has led to knowledge being left to rot in a way that it wouldn't in a physical media world. This is due to a combined effect of the plummeting costs of digital and 'link rot' across the web. One study found that 75% of academic reference URLs no longer work. Information can be deleted and changed, even after it has been published, without a reference copy to verify the content. At the same time, artificial intelligence (AI) generated language is leading to rapidly increasing volumes of ‘tortured language’, citations of non-existent literature and ad hoc, uncredited image reuse in previously respectable scientific literature. There are also some suggestions that AI is even being used to formulate core theorems and data. Despite it not being seen as an academically robust source of information a new study suggests that content from Wikipedia is shaping the language that researchers are using in their outputs. A study showed that words and phrases in recently published Wikipedia articles subsequently appeared more frequently in scientific papers. However there is some debate that this phenomena may also reflect academics using Wikipedia as a way to standardise their language when writing papers. Another recent study based on German citizens has attempted to gauge public ability to assess the trustworthiness of digital media. It found that people often find it difficult to distinguish between different forms of communication, i.e between advertising, information, disinformation, and opinion. While trustworthiness was reasonably easy to identify, people were less likely to recognise, nor articulate conflicts of interest, such as an airport operator extolling the merits of flying. Efforts from social media to label disinformation were not found to be effective, and many people believed that journalism works in partnership with politics to manipulate public opinion. Competency in differentiating between trustworthy and non-trustworthy sources was found to be closely linked to younger age groups, education level but also democratic attitudes, with more &%23160;progressive political beliefs linked to higher levels of media literacy. Better education and greater transparency from media outlets, including social media is recommended as means to rectify this issue. All of the above examples highlight challenges that technology brings to both providing evidence and provoking decision making and action. &%23160;Maintaining access to impartial, verifiable and durable evidence may become increasingly challenging and costly as digital prevails. The ability to spread misinformation, particularly among harder to reach sections of the public may also prove challenging for evidence based institutions. Transformation to digital information may therefore require more, rather than less investment in management and education to fully embrace the benefits of frictionless distribution and use.</p>",<p>https&%2358;//www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/06/the-internet-is-a-collective-hallucination/619320/</p>,<p>The Internet is rotting</p>,The Atlantic,30/06/2021,Zittrain.

Madrid’s urban forest is meant to become a low maintenance sustainable solution to mitigate climate change and adapt to cope with the urban “heat island” effect, capture emissions from urban pollution and lifestyle and to improve the air quality in the city. It is noteworthy that they have decided to use indigenous tree species, and emphasis is also on creation of habitat corridors by connecting existing forest areas around Madrid and utilising derelict urban areas and spaced between roads. Madrid building a 'green wall' is a key step not just reducing carbon but in education people about the change towards sustainable living and reduced carbon footprint, to embrace new greener culture alongside restricting traffic and promoting pedestrianisation and cycling.

15125,19/08/2021,Liisa Tang,<p>Sponge material for pavements mitigates flash floods and helps water being absorbed into the ground.</p>,"<p>As urban areas have been expanded and green areas reduced, there is nowhere for the runoff to go from pavements and roofs but transforming cities with this novel alternative material could be a cost-effective way to combat flooding. Converting the material of urban pavements and car parks could mitigate the rainfall and flash flooding impacts due to the new innovative material that is porous enough to let the rainwater through into the ground but keeps pollutants out. Adding more green space in urban settings is not always realistic and therefore the improved alternative materials such as provided by AquiPor, a new urban stormwater systems solution, can mitigate the impacts of flash flooding cheaply in urban areas. Permeable pavement materials are not a novel concept, but the previous porous materials had not solved the challenge of filtering out pollution the way AquiPor does. Nevertheless, the amount of water running off from pavements increases during heavy downpours and storms and the intensity and frequency of these rainstorm events has increased because of climate change. Recently, one of the Chinese “sponge cities”, where their infrastructure had been retrofitted, could not cope with the heavy rain as the volume of stormwater was above the capability of what Zhengzhou's drainage system could handle. Stormwater could be viewed as an asset in a geographical location that has drought-floods cycles such as Los Angeles and ensuring it goes into the ground rather than flows into drain system and to the ocean.</p>",<p>https&%2358;//www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/flood-rainfall-climate-crisis-solution-b1895487.html</p>,<p>Can ‘sponge’ pavement save us from urban flash floods?</p>,The Independent,03/08/2021,"Sandoval, K.","<p><a style=""color&%2358;%230563c1;text-decoration&%2358;underline;"" href=""https&%2358;//www.fastcompany.com/90660862/this-porous-pavement-helps-prevent-flooding-by-absorbing-rain"">https&%2358;//www.fastcompany.com/90660862/this-porous-pavement-helps-prevent-flooding-by-absorbing-rain</a></p><p><a style=""color&%2358;%230563c1;text-decoration&%2358;underline;"" href=""https&%2358;//www.voanews.com/east-asia-pacific/chinas-sponge-cities-absorb-rainwater-pushed-past-limits"">https&%2358;//www.voanews.com/east-asia-pacific/chinas-sponge-cities-absorb-rainwater-pushed-past-limits</a></p><p>https&%2358;//www.sciencenewsforstudents.org/article/warming-cities-may-see-more-rain-and-frequent-flooding</p><p><u>https&%2358;//www.pnas.org/content/118/4/e2017524118</u></p>",water1,flood runoff,,building,road construction material,2 - advisory work,3 - some development needed,2 - credible,<p>materials pavements roads urban cities floods “flash floods” rainfall storms stormwater runoff China “sponge cities” Germany Texas “Los Angeles”</p>,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],18/05/2022 11:46,"Loveday, Tim",19/08/2021 12:41,"Tang, Liisa",0,,,,,Liisa Tang

Canals are man made channels, therefore it is interesting to apply a man made approach to addressing similar challenges. Canals are important for irrigation in many areas of the World. California relies on 4,000 miles of canals for drinking water and agricultural uses. Researchers have calculated that suspending solar panels above these canals could save 63 billion gallons of water annually, as well as making considerable land savings from not using it for solar farms. Not only does the canal provide space for solar panels it also acts as a cooling mechanism, allowing the solar panels to operate efficiently. A similar solar canal scheme in Gujarat, India has produced favourable results and encouraged other states to commission similar projects. The UK’s canal network could be utilised in a similar fashion, however with much of this network currently used for leisure and tourism there may be potential conflicts associated with deployment without full considerations.

15122,17/08/2021,Jason Dinsdale,<p>Consumer trends galvanised and increasingly habitualised by the coronavirus pandemic may have the effect of reshaping city life away from currently desirable models of urban sustainability.&%23160;</p>,"<p>These changes could be of interest to the Environment Agency, which considers itself a placemaker with a placed based agenda, and may also provide it with opportunities to partner on certain activities. Many planners are increasingly interested in Carlos Moreno’s concept of the 15 minute city, where cities are designed so that urban residents are able to meet most of their needs within a 15 minute walk or bicycle ride from their homes. Post Covid-19 pandemic the concept is accelerating consideration of the 15 minute city concept, with cities including Paris and Portland, USA taking steps to introduce the concept through new trees and cycleways, community facilities and social housing, homes and workplaces. Key to developing this is to introduce areas of mixed use, rather than ‘mono-activity’—a single commercial activity occupying a whole street. &%23160;Space and time are key to defining the ‘radius ’ of the 15 minute city, which could be anything from three quarters of a mile (walking) to three miles (bicycle), which in turn defines the potential urban density and area of such a community. Crucially however transport networks favour pedestrians, cyclists and e-cyclists rather than private combustion engine vehicles. One of the consequences of pandemic lockdown was a move away from physical high street presence to virtual business models for many goods and services, who in turn relied upon third party logistics services to connect to customers. UK examples of these services include Deliveroo, Just Eat and Uber Eats, where orders of takeaway food and groceries are collected and delivered locally, often by couriers on bicycles and e-cycles, but also motorised vehicles. These are examples of ‘Q-commerce’, (‘Q’ for ‘quick’), seen as the next evolution of online retail, where groceries and other items are available in minutes via a network of locally operating couriers. Speed plays into the human desire for instant gratification&%2358; a focus on customer satisfaction and economic competition could mean that such services question the viability of the recognised 15 minute city model, and produce a very different one. For example ‘cloud kitchens’ (commercial kitchens without an expensive high street presence) have increased in prominence during the pandemic, many of which are turning to autonomous cooking processes to speed up fulfillment. ‘Dark stores’ or ‘D-marts’ are also appearing with similar business models for groceries and other household items. The desire for speed and convenience threatens the viability of local physical businesses and jobs. The proposed infrastructure of the 15 minute city actually facilitates Q-commerce models rather than discourages them. However there are currently some signs that the business models underpinning food delivery are economically unsustainable in the long run. Less social visibility may also encourage certain criminal activities to flourish in ways that make it difficult for authorities to monitor and act. Neither are ‘fast-cities’ conducive to building neighbourhoods and communities - places indeed, hence the ‘Slow Cities’ movement. There are some suggestions that taxation, business rates could encourage a hybrid model where virtual and physical businesses operate together, but there is also a question of personal choice. Some also see potential utility in delivery drivers being trained to spot crimes for example. There may also be environmental monitoring opportunities from engaging in educating delivery services in spotting environmental crimes too.&%23160;The Environment Agency and partners may need to be mindful of all the direct and indirect forces shaping the urban agenda to ensure that future planning decisions create sustainably liveable spaces for all.</p>",<p>https&%2358;//pmadden.medium.com/the-instant-city-how-the-desire-for-speedy-gratification-is-reshaping-our-urban-lives-fda8f4603045</p>,<p>The instant city&%2358; how the desire for speedy gratification is reshaping our urban lives</p>,Medium,04/05/2021,"Madden, P","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//thenewsstation.com/how-the-pandemic-changed-the-milan-drug-scene/"">How The Pandemic Changed The Milan Drug Scene - The News Station</a></p><p dir=""ltr""><strong><a href=""https&%2358;//www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-57428966"">Deliveroo couriers can train to spot crimes - BBC News</a></strong></p><p dir=""ltr""><strong><a href=""https&%2358;//restofworld.org/2021/robochef-meet-dosa/"">Delicious biryani, compliments to the robo-chef - Rest of World</a></strong></p><p dir=""ltr""><strong><a href=""https&%2358;//www.powertochange.org.uk/research/saving-high-street-community-takeover/"">Saving the High Street&%2358; the Community Takeover - Power to Change</a></strong></p><p dir=""ltr""><strong><a href=""https&%2358;//www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-11-12/paris-s-15-minute-city-could-be-coming-to-an-urban-area-near-you"">Paris’s 15-Minute City Could Be Coming to an Urban Area Near You - Bloomberg</a></strong></p><p dir=""ltr""><strong><a href=""https&%2358;//www.mdpi.com/2624-6511/4/1/6"">Smart Cities | Free Full-Text | Introducing the “15-Minute City”&%2358; Sustainability, Resilience and Place Identity in Future Post-Pandemic Cities (mdpi.com)</a></strong></p><p dir=""ltr""><a href=""https&%2358;//www.nakedcapitalism.com/2021/08/hubert-horan-can-uber-ever-deliver-part-twenty-six-with-no-hope-of-real-profits-uber-and-lyft-double-down-on-fake-profit-metrics.html"">Hubert Horan&%2358; Can Uber Ever Deliver?

When water is in contact with an electrode surface, all the molecules do not react in a similar manner but the top layer of water molecules located nearest to the electrode respond in a different way to the rest of the water molecules.

15120,05/08/2021,Liisa Tang,<p>Recovery of recyclable natural resources plays a role in a society promoting circular economy and more sustainable processes.</p>,"<p>There are several new technologies paving the way for a more sustainable use and reuse of resources as the amount of valuable materials that end up as waste must be reduced. Recovery and reuse of recyclable natural resources can also reduce the adverse impacts of waste to human health and environment. As disposable nappies manufactured in the 1960s are still sitting in landfills, and are likely to be there for 500 years, a new project has produced a sustainable alternative to the current cloth and disposable nappies by using citrus agricultural waste, a process that is cheaper and uses considerably less water than typical nappy manufacturing process. &%23160;To save citrus waste from landfills in California, researchers used it to grow bacterial cellulose that is highly absorbent and then permeated them with mushroom spores which enables composting in only a year’s time. Likewise, shells of a common tropical fruit tamarind normally end up in landfills as an agricultural waste. However, they can be processed to make perfectly functioning carbon nanosheets for electricity storage as the porosity of the shells increases the area of carbon in the nanosheets which means they can store more electricity within supercapacitors. Supercapacitors are used to store energy in cars, electric vehicles, trains, and lifts. These nanosheets not only cut waste but offer an eco-friendly alternative that performs as well as industrially made nanosheets.

The article highlights how artificial lighting can affect visual ecology, especially colour perception, in comparison to natural light, as the scientists studied over 20 different types of artificial lighting for their impacts on the vision of moths, and birds, their predators. The researchers concentrated in using the eyed hawkmoth (Smerinthus ocellata) colour vision as a case study because hawkmoths have an essential role as nocturnal pollinators, therefore impacting agriculture. This study is relevant to our work as moths are equally important pollinators as bees and their numbers have been in decline for decades, which has been increasingly linked to the increased light pollution, especially for the nocturnal moth species.

In June 2021 JBS the World’s largest meat producer was impacted by a ransomware attack which took out operations in multiple countries and affected thousands of workers. it also impacted one fifth of US beef capacity.&%23160;A Russian based ransomware attack paralysed the networks of at least 200 US companies in July 2021, forcing users to shut down their servers. The attack was seemingly planned to coincide with a public holiday. While Governments tend to advise companies not to pay ransomware demands as it may encourage repeat attacks, bosses of the US Colonial Pipeline paid a $4.4M ransom to restore operations to the pipeline which supplies 45 per cent of East Coast diesel fuel. The Environment Agency may need to consider its position on ransomware attacks, particularly if they are timed to occur with major incidents, compromising our ability to respond. There is also the possibility that cyber attacks on operators could lead to significant civil disruption, and may also cause environmental harm through pollution incidents, for example. This may raise the question of whether some assurance of digital security could become part of conditions to operate and prevent environmental incidents and civil unrest.</p>",<p>https&%2358;//news.sky.com/story/hundreds-of-us-companies-hit-by-devastating-ransomware-attack-cyber-experts-say-12347801</p>,"<p>Hundreds of US companies hit by 'devastating' ransomware attack, cyber experts say</p>",Sky News,03/07/2021,,"<p dir=""ltr""><a href=""https&%2358;//www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2021/04/19/610514.htm"">Cyber Attacks on the Rise for Businesses, Pushing Many to the Brink&%2358; Hiscox (insurancejournal.com)</a></p><p dir=""ltr""><a href=""https&%2358;//www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-57318965"">JBS&%2358; Cyber-attack hits world's largest meat supplier - BBC News</a></p><p dir=""ltr""><a href=""https&%2358;//www.cpomagazine.com/cyber-security/a-suspected-ransomware-cyber-attack-shuts-down-worlds-fifth-largest-beermaker-molson-coors/"">A Suspected Ransomware Cyber Attack Shuts Down World’s Fifth Largest Beermaker Molson Coors - CPO Magazine</a></p><p dir=""ltr""><a href=""https&%2358;//www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-57178503"">Colonial Pipeline boss confirms $4.4m ransom payment - BBC News</a></p>","disasters, accidents, risk",risk assessment,risk management,information,,1 - operational work,1 - realised,2 - credible,<p>&quot;information technology&quot; network internet cyberattack ransomware threat risk incident regulation food supply logistics meat cheese shortage beer Molson Coors JBS &quot;Colonial Pipeline&quot; coronavirus &quot;home working&quot; holiday workforce</p>,No,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],18/05/2022 11:46,"Loveday, Tim",05/08/2021 11:17,"Dinsdale, Jason",0,,,,,Jason Dinsdale
15116,04/08/2021,Jason Dinsdale,<p>Governments and corporations around the world are increasingly the subjects of litigation to reduce the impacts of climate change.&%23160;</p>,"<p>Globally this number stands at around 1500 climate related lawsuits and is thought to likely increase. There is both ample evidence and a growing awareness of climate change becoming one of the most significant drivers of biodiversity loss. It may therefore follow that both evidence and awareness similarly lead biodiversity to the courts. Climate litigation has driven mitigation, as exemplified recently by action the Dutch government brought against a major oil company. Previously biodiversity litigation has focussed mainly on remedying pollution, remaining largely untested in addressing leading drivers of biodiversity loss. This presents an opportunity for conservation strategy to leverage liability litigation to better &%23160;address the actual drivers of biodiversity loss, such as illegal harvest, with the goal of making the injured parties ‘whole’ through e.g. species rehabilitation, public apologies, habitat conservation and education. The embryonic conservation lawsuit movement currently lacks specialist legal skills and knowledge needed. But this could change&%2358; a recently convened legal definition of ‘ecocide’ paves the way for it to become a new crime under international law. New frameworks could allow government agencies, individuals, NGOs and corporate plaintiffs, to more easily seek remedies for ecosystem harm. In parallel the financial sector is increasingly concerned with liability risks associated with biodiversity related losses. This all highlights how the courtroom may increasingly be an effective conservation tool, creating new avenues for justice and financial support.</p>",<p>https&%2358;//conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/conl.12821?af</p>,<p>Environmental liability litigation could remedy biodiversity loss</p>,Conservation Letters,09/06/2021,"Phelps, J; et al","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-57641167"">Climate change&%2358; Courts set for rise in compensation cases - BBC News</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.cbd.int/climate/intro.shtml"">Introduction (cbd.int)</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-57257982"">Shell&%2358; Netherlands court orders oil giant to cut emissions - BBC News</a></p><p>Independent Expert Panel for the Legal Definition of Ecocide COMMENTARY AND CORE TEXT June 2021%23%23https&%2358;//static1.squarespace.com/static/5ca2608ab914493c64ef1f6d/t/60d1e6e604fae2201d03407f/1624368879048/SE+Foundation+Commentary+and+core+text+rev+6.pdf</p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.f4b-initiative.net/post/what-are-the-biodiversity-related-legal-liability-risks-for-financial-institutions"">What are the biodiversity related legal liability risks for financial institutions?

The concept of solving nature and climate problems at the same time is not novel, however action still seems to be lacking. Climate change and reducing emissions are now concepts familiar to many and often a large focus of corporates. Unfortunately the nature crisis and threats to biodiversity do not have the same level of attention and often get overlooked. Scientists are now calling for more dual action that focusses on solving both crises at the same time. They argue that without this joint effort, both problems will never be solved. Climate change solutions risk unintended negative consequences for nature unless the sustainable use of natural capital is considered. Nature based solutions if properly set up can help address both issues. As a trusted partner the Environment Agency would benefit society by sharing best practice on nature based solutions and encouraging other organisations to consider solutions that tackle both crises together.","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jun/10/climate-and-nature-crises-solve-both-or-solve-neither-say-experts"">https&%2358;//www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jun/10/climate-and-nature-crises-solve-both-or-solve-neither-say-experts</a></p>","Climate and nature crises&%2358; solve both or solve neither, say experts",The Guardian,10/06/2021,"Carrington, D","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/cambridge-researchers-lead-policy-briefing-on-nature-based-solutions-for-the-climate-and"">Cambridge researchers lead policy briefing on Nature-based Solutions for the climate and biodiversity crises</a></p>","natural areas, landscape, ecosystems",natural value,,climate,,1 - operational work,1 - realised,2 - credible,“climate change” climate warming temperature emissions nature air water land soil crisis emergency pollution waste biodiversity,No,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],18/05/2022 11:46,"Loveday, Tim",04/08/2021 11:26,"LeAnstey, Becky",0,,,,,Becky LeAnstey

This is an interesting development in that it challenges the assumption that car sized electric vehicles are the natural successor to petrol and diesel cars, whereas this measure promotes both clean transport and health, through increased exercise and reduced air pollution. This development may also present a challenge to the assumptions on urban road design and use currently in formation.

The significance to Defra and Environment Agency is that edible insects provide a more environmentally friendly source of protein and thus will contribute to Farm to Fork strategy and as a part of the solution to climate change mitigation. Achieving authorisation for insects as human food can be regarded as a step towards cutting the emission of greenhouse gases in food production because insects require less feed to grow and produce less carbon dioxide and waste than other similar food sources. It is necessary to bear on mind that insects have been historically consumed as a source of protein around the world but in European Union they are regarded as a novel food that requires a change in legislation to assure consumers of the safety of eating insects, and for example assessing the risk of possible allergic reactions after consumption. The regulation of the edible insects farming may be under Environment Agency’s remit and regulatory responsibility as part of agriculture or animal products, and we can look forward to other insect-based foods, including certain cricket and locust types, and lesser mealworms.</p>","<p><a style=""color&%2358;%230563c1;text-decoration&%2358;underline;"" href=""https&%2358;//ec.europa.eu/food/safety/novel_food/authorisations/approval-first-insect-novel-food_en"">https&%2358;//ec.europa.eu/food/safety/novel_food/authorisations/approval-first-insect-novel-food_en</a></p>",<p>Approval of first insect as Novel Food</p>,European Commission,01/06/2021,n/k,"<p><a style=""color&%2358;%230563c1;text-decoration&%2358;underline;"" href=""https&%2358;//www.adas.uk/News/farming-insects-in-the-uk"">https&%2358;//www.adas.uk/News/farming-insects-in-the-uk</a></p><p class=""MsoPlainText""><a style=""color&%2358;%230563c1;text-decoration&%2358;underline;"" href=""https&%2358;//www.reuters.com/lifestyle/oddly-enough/french-restaurant-serves-up-food-future-insects-2021-05-31/"">https&%2358;//www.reuters.com/lifestyle/oddly-enough/french-restaurant-serves-up-food-future-insects-2021-05-31/</a></p><p class=""MsoPlainText""><a style=""color&%2358;%230563c1;text-decoration&%2358;underline;"" href=""https&%2358;//www.theguardian.com/food/2021/feb/01/grubs-up-mealworms-are-on-the-menu-but-are-we-ready-for-them"">https&%2358;//www.theguardian.com/food/2021/feb/01/grubs-up-mealworms-are-on-the-menu-but-are-we-ready-for-them</a></p>","food, drinking water",novel food,,"food, drinking water",,2 - advisory work,2 - near to realisation,1 - Highly credible,<p>insects mealworms larvae “yellow mealworm” “Tenebrio molitor” food nutrition “novelty food” protein “human consumption” consumers “consumer behaviour “ “Novel Food Regulation” Agronutris Europe</p>,No,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],18/05/2022 11:46,"Loveday, Tim",23/07/2021 14:06,"Tang, Liisa",0,,,,,Liisa Tang

15109,15/07/2021,Jason Dinsdale,<p>Changing generational economic and environmental values may contribute to future declines on birthrates.</p>,"<p>In the face of climate change impacts and environmental degradation, it’s reported that those in the ‘Generation Y’ or ‘Millennials’ cohort (those born roughly between 1981 and 1996) are choosing to “birthstrike”. The Birthstrike movement centres on the idea that people choose not to have children due to the perceived political inaction on climate change. Several criticisms have arisen from people taking this position&%2358; that not becoming parents won’t make a huge difference to reducing climate pressure; that there are more pressing systematic causes; that it absolves policy makers of responsibility. However the birthstrike movement sees itself more as a statement than a solution&%2358; many birthstrikers would wish to be parents but equally wish to highlight fault lines in climate change action and inertia. Some young people from Generation Z (considered to be born 1997 onwards) are making similar decisions on not starting a family. Research suggests that one in 10 childless 18- to 23-year-olds are considering not having children. Gen Z-ers are basing their choices on a raft of pressures including climate change, but also the coronavirus pandemic and general social anxiety are also referenced as drivers towards choosing not to have children. &%23160;However there is also a financial element at play&%2358; some are considering not parenting in order so that they can retire early or afford less work-orientated lifestyles. Childless by choice also has a regional perspective, with Londoners being more likely to not have children if it meant bringing forward retirement. While the scale of impact of these choices may not impact population trends on a global scale, it may have some localised impacts in terms of future service provision and housing planning, which in turn may also have indirect impacts on Environment Agency activities around water resources and flood management. It may also influence workplace demographics, particularly if less women take parental leave as tends to be the current norm.</p>",<p>https&%2358;//www.theguardian.com/society/2021/apr/23/i-had-second-thoughts-the-gen-z-ers-choosing-not-to-have-children</p>,<p>‘I had second thoughts’&%2358; the Gen Z-ers choosing not to have children</p>,The Guardian,23/04/2021,"Hill, A","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//quillette.com/2021/01/20/birthstrike-the-movement-to-end-all-movements/"">BirthStrike&%2358; The Movement to End All Movements – Quillette</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//qz.com/1590642/these-millennials-are-going-on-birth-strike-due-to-climate-change/"">These millennials are going on “birth strike” due to climate change — Quartz (qz.com)</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/01/17/where-millennials-end-and-generation-z-begins/"">Where Millennials end and Generation Z begins | Pew Research Center</a></p>",climate,climate change adaptation,,"social aspects, population",population trend,1 - operational work,2 - near to realisation,3 - less credible,<p>population demographic birth rate &quot;birthstrike&quot; &quot;birth strike&quot; &quot;generation y&quot; GenY millennial GenZ &quot;Gen Z-er&quot; &quot;generation z&quot; &quot;climate change&quot; wealth housing flooding planning London social anxiety finance workforce workplace &quot;parental leave&quot;</p>,No,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],18/05/2022 11:46,"Loveday, Tim",15/07/2021 16:07,"Dinsdale, Jason",0,,,,,Jason Dinsdale
15108,14/07/2021,Becky LeAnstey,New wind turbine design could make urban wind energy a reality.,"Bladeless wind turbines could make wind generation in urban areas more feasible. The designs are not meant to challenge traditional wind power generation, instead they are complimentary. They are much smaller in size and therefore can be sited in urban areas that are not suitable for large scale wind farms. As wind speeds are generally higher at night, they could be complementary to home solar, filling the gap in production at night. The turbines also have a number of other benefits such as a reduction in noise pollution, lower cost and lower environmental impact. As they are smaller they require fewer resources to produce, assemble and maintain. Being bladeless they also reduce the risk of bird strikes. This is another example of decarbonisation solutions emerging that have the potential to drive energy generation decentralisation. The Environment Agency will need to take a holistic systems based approach to assess the multiple different solutions and where they are best suited if they are to successfully regulate such technologies in the future.","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//energyindemand.com/2021/03/20/skybrators-can-generate-clean-energy-without-environmental-impact-of-large-windfarms-says-green-start-up/"">https&%2358;//energyindemand.com/2021/03/20/skybrators-can-generate-clean-energy-without-environmental-impact-of-large-windfarms-says-green-start-up/</a></p>",Good vibrations&%2358; bladeless turbines could bring wind power to your home,Energy in Demand,20/03/2021,,"<p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.inceptivemind.com/powerpod-safest-most-powerful-wind-turbine-urban-spaces/18531/"">PowerPod, the safest, most powerful wind turbine designed for urban spaces</a></p>",energy,wind power,,climate,,1 - operational work,3 - some development needed,3 - less credible,Carbon pollution “climate change” wind energy emissions solution waste recycle noise ecology biodiversity cities decentralisation,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],18/05/2022 11:46,"Loveday, Tim",14/07/2021 18:02,"LeAnstey, Becky",0,,,,,Becky LeAnstey
15106,13/07/2021,Becky LeAnstey,Credibility of carbon offsets called into question.,"The benefits of nature based solutions to carbon emissions can be significant for both the environment and people by restoring habitat and creating jobs. However, an investigation by Greenpeace suggests that the accounting in these schemes is flawed, which risks companies overstating the carbon emissions they are removing from the atmosphere when they use them. Carbon offsets are used as a mechanism to offset the residual emissions that companies cannot currently eliminate. It is hoped that the need for these offsets will reduce as technology and reduction strategies further drive down emissions. Consumer awareness of the need to reduce emissions has rapidly increased during the pandemic. This has led to a surge in demand by businesses for offsets from the voluntary market. The complicated accounting methods, the need for additionality (proving these schemes would not have happened anyway) and permanence all add to the difficulty. As a result industry have launched the Taskforce on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets as a way to manage and certify the market. Unfortunately this too has faced criticism for being run by industry for industry. As the Environment Agency strive to meet their Net Zero commitment they will need to address the uncertainties and carefully assess the offsetting schemes they join to prevent the risk of being accused of greenwashing. It is clear that there can be significant environmental benefits from the conservation work achieved from funding carbon offset schemes, but careful management on emissions claims will be required.","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/may/04/carbon-offsets-used-by-major-airlines-based-on-flawed-system-warn-experts"">https&%2358;//www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/may/04/carbon-offsets-used-by-major-airlines-based-on-flawed-system-warn-experts</a></p>","Carbon offsets used by major airlines based on flawed system, warn experts.",The Guardian,04/05/2021,"Greenfield, P","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jul/08/business-and-finance-group-reveals-plans-for-carbon-offset-regulator"">Businesses and experts reveal plans for carbon offset regulator</a></p> <p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.sciencenews.org/article/planting-trees-climate-change-carbon-capture-deforestation"">Why planting tons of trees isn’t enough to solve climate change</a></p> <p><a href=""https&%2358;//qz.com/2009746/not-all-carbon-offsets-are-a-scam-but-many-still-are/"">Carbon offsets are going primetime and they’re not ready</a></p>",climate,anthropogenic greenhouse gas,greenhouse gas emissions,climate,,1 - operational work,1 - realised,3 - less credible,Carbon pollution “climate change” waste deforestation forestry offset offsetting accounting greenwashing industry,No,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],18/05/2022 11:46,"Loveday, Tim",13/07/2021 10:19,"LeAnstey, Becky",0,,,,,Becky LeAnstey
15101,06/07/2021,Jason Dinsdale,<p>The United Kingdom could be heading towards devolved powers along regional as well as national lines.</p>,"<p>A recent poll of residents in Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic suggested that the majority see Northern Ireland separating from the United Kingdom within the next 25 years. When asked if they thought NI would be part of the UK in 25 years, 51% of people in NI and 54% in the Republic said NI would have left the UK. 56% of those surveyed in Northern Ireland want their assembly members (MLAs) to vote to stay within the EU Single Market when the matter is put to a vote at Stormont in three years' time. Only 38% indicated they wanted to leave the EU Single Market. All this is suggestive of a further fracturing of the UK on top of growing support for Independence in Scotland and Wales. There has also been a recent resurgence in interest for some degree of political autonomy for Cornwall. This ranges from more devolved powers to interest in becoming a sovereign state, but centrally is a perception that Westminster, urban based policies are not suited to the social, geographical and economical realities of the county. Experiences from the coronavirus pandemic, such as influxes of tourists attempting to escape to a relatively unimpacted area, plus increased interest in property forcing up prices are cited as helping to focus attention on greater autonomy for Cornwall. Cornish is already recognised as a national minority under the European Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities, and more people are identifying as ‘Cornish’ rather than ‘English’. Whereas full independence may seem less plausible, greater devolved powers for Cornwall could materialise with growing support. This also raises questions for similar calls for other regions in the UK, though which don’t have the same minority recognition. Yorkshire for example is comparable population-wise and economically with Scotland, and there is also growing interest for more devolved powers within the county. A politically fractured landscape could in turn manifest as a fractured regulatory landscape, which may present both opportunities for operators and challenges for regulators such as the Environment Agency due to the differences which may occur between borders, which seemingly have the potential to multiply beyond those currently envisaged with devolution of power at nation&%23160;level.<br>&%23160;</p>",<p>https&%2358;//www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/politics/why-cornish-independence-could-be-no-joke</p>,<p>Why Cornish independence could be no joke</p>,Prospect,29/04/2021,"Leigh-Hewitson, N","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-56777985"">NI 100&%2358; Majority believes NI will leave UK within 25 years - BBC News</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainers/welsh-independence"">Election 2021&%2358; Welsh independence | The Institute for Government</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//cde.leeds.ac.uk/2021/05/13/the-rise-of-the-northern-regional-parties/"">The rise of the northern regional parties? &%2358; Centre for Democratic Engagement (leeds.ac.uk)</a></p>",administration,devolution,,legislation,,1 - operational work,4 - signficant development needed,3 - less credible,<p>regulation region regional devolution independence nation nationality minority UK &quot;Northern Ireland&quot; Ireland Irish republic vote referendum border Cornwall Cornish autonomy coronavirus pandemic tourism housing economic political geographical social Yorkshire Wales Scotland Welsh Scottish EU</p>,No,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],18/05/2022 11:46,"Loveday, Tim",06/07/2021 10:01,"Dinsdale, Jason",0,,,,,Jason Dinsdale

Examining the impacts of hormone disrupting chemicals such as phthalates and bisphenols, especially Bisphenol A, is a cross-governmental issue where Environment Agency has an advisory role for the environmental perspective, contributing to Defra’s chemicals strategy. &%23160;Health and Safety Executive, Food Standards Agency, and Public Health England are involved on the reproductive health aspect, addressing the growing concern of microplastics and chemicals in plastics. Everyone is exposed to these chemicals and they accumulate so more research is needed into the environmental fate and a combined effect. The chemical industry should start producing chemicals that are non-hormonally active and hence safe for everyday use. However, there are huge economic interests preventing tougher regulation, and therefore for example in the United states most chemicals have not been tested but are simply assumed to be safe.

15099,05/07/2021,Becky LeAnstey,New method aims to help researchers track nanomaterials through the food chain.,"The environmental and health implications of nanomaterials (NMs) have been speculated and reported on for a number of years. However, the research into the impact of NMs on organisms through the food chain is still relatively limited. A new method published in Nature Communications aims to help researchers trace the movement of NMs through the food chain so that they can better understand how this could influence the health of organisms. Different shapes and sizes of NMs can influence how they are absorbed and what impact they may have on receiving organisms. This makes it very difficult to understand how specific materials influence health, especially as they change in shape and size all the time both in the environment and once inside an organism. For example spherical NMs of the same substance may have a different effect to rod shape NMs. The findings of this research seem to suggest that NM’s can accumulate in the brain. Regulating NMs is difficult due to the fact that they cannot be measured in the traditional way by mass, as they have an effect at such small levels. From a consumer perspective, the authors also highlight that products may already contain NMs, but as it is in such small levels they are not listed in the ingredients list. This makes it impossible for consumers to avoid if they wished to. Recommendations include the importance of assessing the risk of NMs before they are used in large amounts commercially. As a regulator, there still seems to be a considerable level of uncertainty on the influence of NMs in the environment and how that may affect health, making it very difficult to ensure regulations are fit for purpose.","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//news.sky.com/story/an-invisible-killer-is-lurking-in-our-consumer-products-warn-scientists-12213235"">https&%2358;//news.sky.com/story/an-invisible-killer-is-lurking-in-our-consumer-products-warn-scientists-12213235</a></p>","An invisible killer is lurking in our consumer products, warn scientists",Sky News,09/02/2021,,"<p><a href=""https&%2358;//link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42452-019-1412-5"">The engineered nanoparticles in food chain&%2358; potential toxicity and effects</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-21164-w"">Particle number-based trophic transfer of gold nanomaterials in an aquatic food chain</a></p>",materials,,,pollution1,,1 - operational work,1 - realised,2 - credible,Framework pollution health waste nano material industry consumer regulation regulate law compound chemistry complex “food chain” ecosystem nanoparticle engineered toxicity ecotoxicology monitoring Nanotoxicology,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],18/05/2022 11:46,"Loveday, Tim",05/07/2021 16:07,"LeAnstey, Becky",0,,,,,Becky LeAnstey

Studies indicate that younger farmers and female farmers are keener on practising biodiversity-friendly farming management, and with the advances in agricultural technology, making muscular strength superseded, this is seen as the main driver of enabling more women get into farming. Therefore, the role of the women farmers could be utilised by Environment Agency in a move towards more environmentally friendly farming practices to protect biodiversity and in other rural development programmes. It is suggested by researchers that there is a need for improved communications and cooperation between scientists and farmers, and a platform is required to facilitate this type of open dialogue and discussion between researchers, policy makers and farmers. Women farmers could be at the lead of this type of sustainable farming discussions as it seems they are more open to experimenting to find best practice sustainability.</p>","<p><a style=""color&%2358;%230563c1;text-decoration&%2358;underline;"" href=""https&%2358;//www.euractiv.com/section/agriculture-food/news/women-farmers-essential-for-future-says-french-agriculture-minister/"">https&%2358;//www.euractiv.com/section/agriculture-food/news/women-farmers-essential-for-future-says-french-agriculture-minister/</a></p>","<p>Women farmers ‘essential’ for future, says French agriculture minister</p>",Euractiv,10/03/2021,"Eck, D.","<p><u>https&%2358;//www.theguardian.com/food/2020/aug/16/we-are-stewards-of-our-land-the-rise-of-female-farmers</u></p><p><a style=""color&%2358;%230563c1;text-decoration&%2358;underline;"" href=""https&%2358;//www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006320721001178?via%3Dihub"">https&%2358;//www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006320721001178?via%3Dihub</a> </p><p><a style=""color&%2358;%230563c1;text-decoration&%2358;underline;"" href=""https&%2358;//www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00825-2"">https&%2358;//www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00825-2</a></p><p><a style=""color&%2358;%230563c1;text-decoration&%2358;underline;"" href=""https&%2358;//etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/28323/"">https&%2358;//etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/28323/</a></p>",agriculture,environmental impact of agriculture,,"social aspects, population",community participation,1 - operational work,2 - near to realisation,2 - credible,<p>“young farmers” agriculture “modern farming” women age gender “gender gap” “demographic change” France “food production” sustainability biodiversity “agricultural technology”</p>,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],18/05/2022 11:46,"Loveday, Tim",05/07/2021 14:46,"Tang, Liisa",0,,,,,Liisa Tang
15097,05/07/2021,Liisa Tang,<p>Balancing animal welfare and religious freedom can cause problems and have media interest even from fake news.</p>,"<p>In March this year French religious leaders expressed their concerns when it was suggested that the Ministry of Agriculture had proposed a ban on the slaughter practices of poultry, effectively banning slaughter of ritualistic slaughter of chicken following religious practice. If the legislation in the United Kingdom eventually followed France Ministry of Agriculture example and decisions, there could be potential consequences for Environment Agency’s operational work as we support Food Standards Agency. The main approved method for slaughter for religious purposes, and the one practiced in the United Kingdom, Estonia, Slovakia, Finland, Denmark, and New Zealand, is slaughter without prior stunning authorised, but stunning imposed after bleeding. If the halal, meaning “permissible” in Arabic, slaughter is banned here, this could lead to illegal halal slaughtering as is already happening elsewhere in the world, for example the case from Finland with more than a thousand sheep illegally slaughtered for the purpose of providing halal meat for the growing demand. Environment Agency is responsible for monitoring odour and water issues from abattoirs even though they are mainly the responsibility of Food Standards Agency. If rituals related to slaughter were banned by law, there is likelihood of illegal slaughter carried out on sites for black markets, with no permits which could increase the risk of environmental pollution. Eventually the ministry reassured religious communities that the concern was unfounded and that the Islamic slaughter of poultry animals will not be banned in France from July 2021, as stated widely in the news. Quickly slitting the animal’s throat can be seen as a “less humane” method of slaughter, especially by the animal rights activists.</p>",<p>https&%2358;//www.fr24news.com/a/2021/03/muslims-in-france-outraged-by-decision-to-ban-the-slaughter-of-halal-chickens.html</p>,<p>Muslims in France outraged by decision to ban the slaughter of halal chickens</p>,FR24 News - www.fr24news.com,21/03/2021,n/k,<p>https&%2358;//www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/french-muslims-slam-decision-to-ban-halal-chicken-slaughter-ahead-of-ramadan-6675991.html</p><p>https&%2358;//yle.fi/uutiset/3-11742735<br>https&%2358;//www.euractiv.com/section/agriculture-food/news/french-mosques-fear-slaughter-policy-change-is-ban-on-halal-chicken/<br>https&%2358;//www.businessinsider.com/worlds-biggest-halal-meats-exporter-nowhere-near-any-muslim-countries-2017-12?r=US&amp;IR=T<br>&%23160;</p>,"social aspects, population",animal rights,animal protection,"food, drinking water",,1 - operational work,3 - some development needed,2 - credible,<p>legislation slaughter animals livestock poultry “animal rights” rights meat rituals religion halal kosher abattoirs crime illegal “food standards agency” food “food production” “fake news”</p>,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],18/05/2022 11:46,"Loveday, Tim",05/07/2021 11:54,"Tang, Liisa",0,,,,,Liisa Tang
15096,05/07/2021,Liisa Tang,<p>The changing light availability leading to coastal darkening can change phytoplankton composition which has widespread consequences for the ecosystem.</p>,"<p>Scientists have researched the changing light availability in the seas such as Arctic Sea and North Sea, but the constant darkening of coastal areas is an environmental threat that has been overlooked and therefore more research is needed to understand the impacts and to consider potential solutions. The significance to Environment Agency is that the physical changes of clarity and water colour will lead to biological and chemical changes in marine ecosystems, such as timing for phytoplankton which forms the base of the food web and hence can have huge consequences to the whole marine ecosystem. Darkening has already caused a delay of three weeks to the phytoplankton blooms that fish require to spawn in North Sea. Any change in phytoplankton timing and composition has widespread consequences to the marine ecosystems such as favouring certain species over others, for instance fish, kelp, seagrass would suffer as they depend on sunlight but species such as jellyfish would gain a competitive advantage. They don’t rely on clarity of water and sight to feed but instead use their sense of touch which has already led to jellyfish blooms in some locations. Coastal darkening may also have a distinct chemical effect as there will be less sunlight to break down toxic contaminants such as the chemical methyl mercury which then has more time to accumulate and transfer through the food web to human nutrition from fish. A range of processes caused by human activity can make coastal waters become darker, and some of these could be mitigated by enhanced environmental regulation, stricter land use to reduce nutrient run-off for areas that drain to rivers, and hence eventually to the sea. Other activities for environmental regulation could be fertilizer use and timing of agricultural tillage, or requirement to preserve wetlands or to limit boats stirring light-blocking silt as they move. </p>",https&%2358;//www.ecowatch.com/coastal-darkening-ocean-pollution-2650785212.html,What You Need to Know About Coastal Darkening,Ecowatch,25/02/2021,"Duong, T.","<p><a style=""color&%2358;%230563c1;text-decoration&%2358;underline;"" href=""https&%2358;//sciencenorway.no/environmental-surveillance-ocean/the-sea-along-norways-coast-has-gotten-darker-thats-bad-news-for-fish-seagrass-and-kelp/1804006"">https&%2358;//sciencenorway.no/environmental-surveillance-ocean/the-sea-along-norways-coast-has-gotten-darker-thats-bad-news-for-fish-seagrass-and-kelp/1804006</a></p><p><a style=""color&%2358;%230563c1;text-decoration&%2358;underline;"" href=""https&%2358;//www.hakaimagazine.com/news/the-environmental-threat-youve-never-heard-of/"">https&%2358;//www.hakaimagazine.com/news/the-environmental-threat-youve-never-heard-of/</a></p><p><a style=""color&%2358;%230563c1;text-decoration&%2358;underline;"" href=""https&%2358;//uol.de/en/icbm/collaborative-projects/coastal-ocean-darkening"">https&%2358;//uol.de/en/icbm/collaborative-projects/coastal-ocean-darkening</a></p>","natural areas, landscape, ecosystems",,,biology1,marine biodiversity,1 - operational work,2 - near to realisation,2 - credible,<p>seas oceans marine “North Sea” Arctic Norway coasts coastal ecosystems “coastal darkening” light “light availability” biodiversity “climate change” modelling scenarios “environmental regulations” pollution runoff run-off threat agriculture fertilisers sight fish phytoplankton jellyfish “algal blooms” kelp seagrass “organic matter” sediment seafloor “methyl mercury” &%23160;</p>,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],18/05/2022 11:46,"Loveday, Tim",05/07/2021 10:49,"Tang, Liisa",0,,,,,Liisa Tang
15095,05/07/2021,Becky LeAnstey,Fashion is set to join food and energy in competition for land.,"The interdependences between biodiversity and climate change are clear and the benefits that a healthy system can have, can no longer be ignored. The fashion industry is awakening to the fact that it is being increasingly scrutinised for its environmental impact. Researchers are encouraging transparency of supply chains so that consumers know the lifecycle impact of the products they buy, enabling them to make informed purchasing decisions that reflect their values. This has led some progressive fashion brands to explore regenerative farming, as a way to improve their sustainability and by association their reputation. Although these projects are only small scale at the moment, there is potential for rapid increase in the future. Regenerative farming can have significant benefits for climate and the environment, however this will add more competition for land, which is already facing higher demands to supply food and energy to an expanding global human population. As the economy moves to one that values the services nature provides and sees investment in this area, clear oversight and governance will be required to ensure truly sustainable use of land. The Environment Agency may be well placed to help develop the systems thinking that will be required to ensure sustainable land management across the many different sectors involved, in order to achieve the greatest benefits that are future proof for a changing climate.","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.fastcompany.com/90628486/why-patagonia-gucci-and-timberland-are-making-a-big-bet-on-farming"">https&%2358;//www.fastcompany.com/90628486/why-patagonia-gucci-and-timberland-are-making-a-big-bet-on-farming</a></p>",You’ve heard about farm-to-table dining.

Artificial greenery can also have a negative impact on run-off in relation to flood management. Celebrities including Julia Bradbury and Chris Packham have drawn attention to this issue.

Australian researchers have developed a cost effective water purification technique that could deliver enough fresh water for a family from one square metre of source water. This innovation is based around a &%23160;highly efficient photothermal structure sitting on the water’s surface, which converts sunlight to heat. This is focused on the water’s surface to create rapid evaporation. The 3D shape of the new photothermal evaporator is extremely efficient and also draws energy from the water around it, meaning it operates at 170 per cent efficiency. This cheap low maintenance solution could be ideal for small communities where other purification and desalination processes such as reverse osmosis would be too expensive. A team of researchers in Singapore has developed a smart sunlight harvesting device that can relay daylight efficiently into underground spaces for a fraction of the cost of LEDs. The device consists of an off-the-shelf acrylic ball and fibre optic cable. Computerised motors are used to track the sun for optimum light capture, which is then refracted from the ball into the cable and onto the underground location where light is needed. The device can easily be incorporated into existing infrastructure.

In one experiment scientists have created an interactive 3D virtual spider web, based on the scanned dimensions of a real web. Taking into account thread properties such as length and elasticity, they were able to recreate vibration frequencies, scaled to human hearing levels. People could then interact virtually with the model, effectively producing a new form of musical instrument and helping to gain an insight into life as a spider. The researchers also lightly suggest that one day it may be possible to communicate with a spider through a similar interface. Elsewhere researchers have turned to music as an alternative medium for understanding historic activity of a river basin catchment.

15090,22/06/2021,Jason Dinsdale,<p>New evidence is coming to light on the impacts of particulate matter on human health.</p>,"<p>This should be of interest to the Environment Agency as a regulator of particulate matter (PM) emissions. Particulate emissions are generally classified by size into PM10 and PM2.5. It’s the oxidative potential (OP) of a Sources of UFPs include vehicles and wood burners, and tens of thousands of particles can be found in each sugar cube-sized volume of city air. They are thought to pass through the expectant mother’s lungs and into her bloodstream, causing damaging inflammation. They are also likely to cross the placenta into the foetus’s circulation.particle that determines how reactive it might be with other molecules, and therefore its potential to cause inflammation leading to health impacts in humans. Currently there is limited understanding of how different sources contribute the most to each emission category. Recent analysis of air quality data from Switzerland and Liechtenstein has looked at primary and secondary sources of PM and OP. The analysis found that PM with the highest OP came from two anthropogenic sources&%2358; people burning biomass (i.e. from logs) in &%23160;their homes; and &%23160;non-emissions metals, such as copper or chromium from vehicle brake wear. The latter was found to be particularly high in cities. The results suggest that future strategies to reduce overall PM levels may not reduce concentrations of PM with high OP, and therefore not produce the desired effects on human health goals. Separate research has established a link between asthma in toddlers and in-utero exposure to poor air quality, specifically ultra-fine particles (UFPs) with an aerodynamic diameter of 0.1 µm or less. Sources of UFPs also &%23160;include vehicles and wood burners. It is thought that they pass from an expectant mother’s lungs and into her bloodstream, causing damaging inflammation to the unborn baby. The new study followed 400 mothers and babies through pregnancy and beyond. The researchers found that where mothers had been exposed to levels of 30,000/cm3 during pregnancy their children were approximately four times more likely to develop asthma than those whose mothers had been exposed to half of this level - equivalent to a difference in pollution seen when going from a backstreet to a busy road. Currently UFP levels are not regulated by governments. It is suggested that this may be an area of environmental monitoring, protection and regulation that needs more focus.</p>",<p>https&%2358;//www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/may/21/asthma-in-toddlers-linked-to-in-utero-exposure-to-air-pollution-ufps-study-finds</p>,"<p>Asthma in toddlers linked to in-utero exposure to air pollution, study finds</p>",The Guardian,21/05/2021,"Carrington, D","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.atsjournals.org/doi/10.1164/rccm.202010-3743OC"">Prenatal Ambient Ultrafine Particle Exposure and Childhood Asthma in the Northeastern United States | American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine | Articles in Press (atsjournals.org)</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//ec.europa.eu/environment/integration/research/newsalert/pdf/559na1_en-which-sources-of-particle-pollution-may-trigger-inflammation-in-humans.pdf"">Which sources of particle pollution may trigger inflammation in humans?

Once installed on people’s smartphones the app &%23160;establishes a communications network between phones optimising battery use to keep communications going as long as possible. Phones with hire charge act as hubs to relay text messages. As phones become drained of power, other phones are activated to take their place.

15081,09/06/2021,Becky LeAnstey,Growing interest in synthetic fuels could influence the transition to a low carbon economy.,"The synthetic fuels currently of interest to industry are hydrocarbon based like those derived from oil, which means they can be used without any problems in traditional vehicles. Unlike oil based fuels, synthetic fuels derive their hydrogen from water and carbon from the air. Supporters of the technology believe renewable energy can be used to create the hydrogen, and carbon captured from the atmosphere could offset the carbon released from burning the fuel, which is why it is branded carbon neutral. Although currently expensive and uneconomic to produce, a number of investors are exploring due to the expectations of costs reducing with economies of scale and any potential carbon pricing in the future. The application of this fuel also has potential wider than the auto industry, and is why there are trials underway in conjunction with the airline and shipping industries as well. Porshe have teamed up with Siemens to develop a plant in Chile using wind to power and Repsol are investing in a plant in Spain near an oil refinery to capture the carbon dioxide emitted. This again hints at the hub based approach to future industry, siting different organisations together to achieve dual benefits from partnership working. This adds to the intelligence already highlighted of how the Environment Agency may need to consider the impact of geographically distinct hubs on regulation. It remains to be seen if the environmental credentials of this process will stand up to scrutiny and a lot depends on whether it can be made into an economically viable process.","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.wsj.com/articles/can-e-fuels-save-the-combustion-engine-11621037390"">https&%2358;//www.wsj.com/articles/can-e-fuels-save-the-combustion-engine-11621037390</a></p>",Can e-fuels save the combustion engine,The Wall Street Journal/Dow Jones,15/05/2021,Giulia Petroni,"<p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.autoexpress.co.uk/tips-advice/353876/what-are-synthetic-fuels-efuels-cars-explained"">What are synthetic fuels? efuels for cars explained</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/cars/article-9286773/Porsche-begin-production-CO2-slashing-eFuel-year.html"">Porsche to begin production of CO2-slashing eFuel next year | This is Money</a></p>",energy,alternative fuel,,climate,,1 - operational work,3 - some development needed,2 - credible,Fossil fuel carbon pollution emissions waste policy capture investments industry regulation ,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],18/05/2022 11:46,"Loveday, Tim",09/06/2021 12:16,"LeAnstey, Becky",0,,,,,Becky LeAnstey

The new approach involves reducing nitrogen oxide (NO), the main cause of fine dust, into ammonia (NH3) without releasing carbon dioxide (CO2). Current chemical reactions in this space are slow and energy inefficient. The new approach focuses on a nanostructured Ag electrode in conjunction with a rationally designed electrolyte containing the EDTA–Fe2+ metal complex (EFeMC). This gives a near 100 per cent efficiency for NH3, without degrading the catalyst. The new approach is therefore significantly more energy efficient and cost effective than the Haber-Bosch process.

It’s suggested that the jays have episodic memory (corvids like jays and crows are known to be highly intelligent %2314976) &%23160;and that previous experience of the once noisy sites has stopped them returning and storing seeds underground, hence fewer seedlings. However other differences in juniper seedlings and communities of flowers could not be so easily explained, but it’s suggested that noise has similarly kept grazing animals such as deer and insect pollinators away from the sites. Further research is needed, but it’s suggested that tighter noise regulation may be a consequence of this discovery.

The coronavirus pandemic has dramatically altered the economic viability of towns and cities. It’s been estimated that the UK has lost over 17,500 chain outlets, and that there could be as many as 80,000 vacant shops once the impacts of a withdrawl of government support are finally felt. As with many trends Covid has accelerated rather than caused a decline in the high street, particularly in small urban areas. This decline is also offering the potential for experimentation and reinvention of urban space, exemplified by Stockton-on-Tees, where there are plans to demolish one side of the town’s high street and replace it with green space. Similar ambitions can be seen in Nottingham (%2315027). Urban areas are also providing scope for new blue space&%2358; a former shopping mall in Tinan, Taiwan, has been repurposed as an urban lagoon and park, demonstrating further how former urban retail space could be repurposed. In tandem with a reshaping of urban centres the pandemic has led to a house price boom across the globe focussed on suburban locations. One factor is a greater acceptance of remote working practices, but Covid has also revealed a certain resilience of suburban design not present in urban development. Suburbia has historically been viewed as culturally dull and poorly designed with little public space and urban zoning, which encourages reliance on private vehicles. Under pandemic conditions private garden space, private transport and zoned purpose have emerged as advantages, allowing people to work, exercise, shop and travel without in keeping with social distancing. Conventional assumptions of urbanisation have previously focused on high density living, urban infilling of brown space and public green space&%2358; post coronavirus the need for development with a more suburban flavour could influence planning and development, increasing pressure on resources, including that of flood plain development, water resources and construction materials, all of which could impact on the Environment Agency’s remit.</p>",<p>https&%2358;//www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/06/pandemic-suburbs-are-best/613300</p>,<p>Revenge of the Suburbs</p>,The Atlantic,19/06/2020,"Bogost, I","<p>House prices in the rich world are booming%23%23https&%2358;//www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2021/04/08/house-prices-in-the-rich-world-are-booming</p><p>People are returning to the high street, but the retail crash has changed it beyond recognition%23%23https&%2358;//www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/apr/11/returning-high-street-retain-crash-chnaged-covid-restriction-england</p><p>Say Bye-Bye to the High Street%23%23https&%2358;//www.designindaba.com/articles/creative-work/say-bye-bye-high-street</p><p>An old mall becomes an urban lagoon and public square in central Tainan%23%23https&%2358;//inhabitat.com/an-old-mall-becomes-an-urban-lagoon-and-public-square-in-central-tainan/</p>","urban environment, urban stress",building planning,,"urban environment, urban stress",,1 - operational work,2 - near to realisation,2 - credible,<p>urban planning city migration suburban housing development economy retail &quot;high street&quot; shop town&%23160;Stockton-on-Tees Nottingham Tinan Taiwan lagoon park shopping centre vehicle &quot;urban zoning&quot; garden space pandemic coronavirus Covid-19 &quot;social distancing&quot; resilience incident density greenfield brownfield infill resources water floodplain flooding development water construction regulation</p>,No,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],18/05/2022 11:46,"Loveday, Tim",08/06/2021 14:51,"Dinsdale, Jason",0,,,,,jdinsdale
15074,08/06/2021,Becky LeAnstey,A new type of underground enclosed hydropower system may enable gentle slopes to become batteries of the future.,"Instead of a traditional system using water and steep slopes, this new system uses a dense mineral rich fluid which means it only needs a gentle slope to generate electricity. This system would be underground and enclosed which reduces some of the negative environmental impacts that are now associated with hydropower, such as impacts on the health of river based organisms. Just like traditional hydropower, excess energy could be used to pump the fluid uphill to be stored until it is needed in times of peak demand. The energy company RhrEnergise that are developing the technology have identified approximately 700 sites around the UK that may be suitable. It is unclear the exact nature of the fluid that would be used in the system, and the impacts this could have on the surrounding environment in the event of a leak. Understanding the technology in more detail if it nears market viability will be important to incident response planning. Any engineering work involved to create these sites would also need careful planning to limit the environmental impact.","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/feb/08/powering-up-uk-hills-could-be-used-as-energy-batteries"">https&%2358;//www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/feb/08/powering-up-uk-hills-could-be-used-as-energy-batteries</a></p>",Powering up&%2358; UK hills could be used as energy 'batteries',The Guardian,08/02/2021,,,energy,hydroelectric energy,,"disasters, accidents, risk",,1 - operational work,4 - signficant development needed,3 - less credible,Waste pollution energy renewable hydropower climate change transition storage battery incident water ,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],18/05/2022 11:46,"Loveday, Tim",08/06/2021 10:27,"LeAnstey, Becky",0,,,,,Becky LeAnstey
15073,10/05/2021,Liisa Tang,<p>Smoke from more frequent and larger wildfires impacts public health more than previously suspected. </p>,"<p>Wildfires are becoming more extreme, more common as the “fire season” has become longer, and destructive due to climate change, and a new study suggests that smoke and particles from wildfires may be a more pressing public health concern and more harmful source of pollutants to human health than previously thought. Emerging actions for Environment Agency and Defra might include rethinking human activity such as addressing changes in land-use and landscape management for example the benefits from large-scale habitat restoration, or improved early wildfire detection systems to mitigate climate change, although this can be a challenge for example in case of peat fires on moorlands, sometimes called ‘zombie fires.’. Wildfire specific air pollution is potentially even ten times more harmful than other air pollution such as from traffic and industries. The problem is how to identify specific signatures in fire; the lack of marker in the air particles and therefore it can be hard to identify specific sources of pollution with certainty even though this is critically important for understanding the risks. As smoke, soot and other pollutants are released into the air with uncontrolled large fires, the smoke may rise many kilometres high, crossing oceans and countries affecting public health and as it travels, it can make urban air quality and environmental exposures worse. What is not known is exactly how much more toxic the smoke becomes as it ages in the atmosphere, and therefore more research is called for to understand the processes to be able to monitor air pollution better.&%23160; Health officials in Colorado, USA recommend people construct “safe rooms” to protect themselves against “multiple” air pollutants including particulates from wildfires. Wildfires and the air pollution they cause is another vital reason why Environment Agency must work to reduce greenhouse emissions as we cannot regulate the air pollution from fires. Additionally, brown carbon, the soot released by fires, can absorb heat from the sun and hence can make global warming worse.</p>",<p>https&%2358;//www.ecowatch.com/wildfire-smoke-toxic-pollution-2650974582.html?mc_cid=afc588b09d&amp;mc_eid=61f523d301</p>,"Wildfire Smoke Is More Toxic Than Other Forms of Air Pollution, Study Finds",Ecowatch,08/03/2021,"Rosane, O.","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.denverpost.com/2020/08/25/colorado-wildfire-smoke-pollution-ozone/"">Health-harming ozone spikes as wildfire haze, record heat hang over Denver (denverpost.com)</a><br>https&%2358;//horizon-magazine.eu/article/four-times-more-toxic-how-wildfire-smoke-ages-over-time.html<br>https&%2358;//environmentjournal.online/articles/increased-wildfires-are-putting-thousands-of-species-at-risk/<br>https&%2358;//www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-03/uoc--fpm030321.php<br>https&%2358;//cordis.europa.eu/project/id/726165<br>https&%2358;//www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/may/01/its-become-them-and-us-battle-to-burn-englands-moorlands<br>https&%2358;//www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-21708-0.pdf<br>https&%2358;//www.ecowatch.com/california-wildfires-2021-2652873703.html<br>https&%2358;//www.atlasobscura.com/articles/underground-peat-fires<br>&%23160;</p>",human health,air quality impact,,air,air quality impact,1 - operational work,3 - some development needed,2 - credible,<p>weather fires wildfires “zombie fires” “wildfire smoke” smoke plumes peat “blanket bogs” “Underground peat fires” forests grasslands moors moorlands “biomass burning” “human health” “public health” toxicity “environmental health” heart organs respiratory hospitalisation pollution “air pollution” “air quality” “free radicals” particles “particulate matter” frequency season “climate change” atmosphere stratosphere “atmospheric lifetime” Yorkshire California</p>,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],18/05/2022 11:46,"Loveday, Tim",26/05/2021 16:16,"Loveday, Tim",0,,,,,Liisa Tang

The European Commission’s Direct Interspecies Electron Transfer (DIET) project that has recently concluded was able to find solutions to overcome essential problems in aerobic digestive process; resulting to increased efficiency and thereby permitting the reduction of the digester’s size yet producing the same quantity of biogas. &%23160;This was possible by adding an electrically conductive material, in this case graphene, to a digester, thus enhancing the biomethane production rate by 20-40% in comparison to the currently existing technology. This evidence supports need for further research into pyrochar that is almost as effective as a conductive material as graphene that was used for these laboratory experiments, but 200 times cheaper. Introduction of pyrochar to the process can further facilitate advances in anaerobic digestation process efficiencies and develop circular economy systems for the future.

The relevance to Environment Agency is that this is another novel technology that could be used to monitor the quality of air, water, and soil, especially top soils, without causing further environmental damage as the I-seeds are biodegradable and do not require any energy supply to function. The project aims to replicate the morphology of plant seeds and study most suited biodegradable materials including polymers and hydrogels that would simultaneously act as sensors and actuators. Focus will be on developing two types of I-seeds&%2358; I-Seed ERO will have a screw type shape that enables penetrating the soil whereas I-Seed SAM remains monitoring the soil surface. Deployment will be done with drones, and the researchers will use a specific software to control the I-seeds for them to be dispersed in the desired geographical locations, then track their position and monitor according to required data needs. Use of LIDAR system permits tracking I-seed robots over long distances and thus enables environmental monitoring of areas that are normally hard to reach.

The Environment Agency and partners may have regulatory roles regarding genetically altered life forms, which may prove challenging if the output of these greatly increases from ease of design and production. A recent study has revealed that CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing could lead to unintended DNA mutations, despite CRISPR being widely regarded as a precision technique. Retrospective analysis of data from human embryo experiments found large unintended mutations in approximately 16 per cent &%23160;of samples. Conventional assessment methods would have missed these DNA changes, and emphasises that unintended mutations can develop without rigorous assessment. A new app has been developed by a separate team of researchers to more readily identify what has changed in a DNA sequence during CRISPR alteration. Elsewhere researchers have taken a CAD (computer aided design) approach to genetics, developing a platform that enables the costs of genome design to be slashed while bringing a degree of utility far beyond current approaches such as CRISPR. Using CAD means that adding for example a new metabolic pathway, CAD will make all the necessary changes in the genome, and catch coding errors, which could produce a dysfunctional cell, which today requires expert human assessment. The CAD platform will be freely available to academics, and some companies&%2358; others will be charged. The platform will also facilitate users sending their CAD files to synthetic DNA manufacturers. While the CAD will meet current safety regulations there are ethical concerns from some that an easy-to-use platform could make less experienced users overestimate the reliability of the CAD’s predicted outcomes, and that a review of regulations is needed to account for the differences in different types of organisms and different applications internationally.</p>",<p>https&%2358;//spectrum.ieee.org/the-human-os/biomedical/ethics/with-this-cad-for-genomes-you-can-design-new-organisms</p>,"<p>With this CAD for genomes, you can design new organisms</p>",IEEE Spectrum,11/03/2021,"Strickland, E","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//phys.org/news/2021-04-greater-awareness-unintended-consequences-crispr.html"">Researchers call for greater awareness of unintended consequences of CRISPR gene editing</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.pnas.org/content/early/2021/04/09/2004832117"">Frequent loss-of-heterozygosity in CRISPR-Cas9–edited early human embryos</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//crisprmedicinenews.com/news/new-app-can-reveal-unintentional-mutations-of-a-crispr-edit/"">New app can reveal unintentional mutations of a CRISPR edit</a></p>",biology1,genetic engineering,,legislation,,1 - operational work,4 - signficant development needed,1 - Highly credible,<p>genetic engineering gene DNA mutation CRISPR &quot;gene editing&quot; &quot;computer-aided design&quot; CAD regulation ethics genome &quot;synthetic biology&quot;</p>,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],18/05/2022 11:46,"Loveday, Tim",26/05/2021 16:16,"Loveday, Tim",0,,,,,Jason Dinsdale

The repairability index is intended to influence consumers to purchase longer lasting, easier to repair products, which in turn would reduce consumer waste and encourage manufacturers to design products with greater environmental considerations. In a similar step the UK government is introducing laws in the Summer of 2021 to give consumers the right to repair the goods they buy. Manufacturers will be legally obliged to make spare parts for products. The new rules could extend product life spans by up to ten &%23160;years, and save consumers an average of £75 a year on bills over their lifetimes. The laws should also reduce electronic waste by 1.5 million tonnes annually.&%23160;</p>",<p>https&%2358;//www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-56340077</p>,<p>'Right to repair' law to come in this summer</p>,BBC,10/03/2021,"Harrabin, R","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.rfi.fr/en/france/20210211-france-launches-worlds-first-repair-index-for-smartphones-laptops-consumer-products-environment-waste-durability-europe"">France launches anti-waste 'repairability' rating for smartphones, laptops</a></p>",waste,electronic scrap regulation,,waste,,1 - operational work,1 - realised,2 - credible,<p>waste WEEE electronic appliance law &quot;right to repair&quot; consumer manufacturing&%23160;smartphone laptop&%23160;&%23160;television&%23160;&quot;washing machine&quot;&%23160;lawn mower efficiency regulation &quot;circular economy&quot; energy</p>,No,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],18/05/2022 11:45,"Loveday, Tim",26/05/2021 16:16,"Loveday, Tim",0,,,,,Jason Dinsdale

15061,18/03/2021,Jason Dinsdale,"<p>A US water treatment plant has narrowly avoided a potentially lethal hack, occurring against a backdrop of increasing sophistication in cyber-crime and subsequent financial pressures on businesses to protect themselves.&%23160;</p>","<p>The Environment Agency may need to take a more considered approach to cybersecurity both in terms of incident potential and regulations. Organisations have a number of tools and techniques at their disposal to prevent and mitigate cyberattack. However a recent report has highlighted that many businesses have experienced ‘counter incident response’, where cybercriminals identify and counter remediation methods. Many UK businesses were impacted by a major cyberattack in early March 2021, of which Microsoft identified four never-before-seen hacking techniques. The company has issued software updates to counter these, but until companies install them they are still vulnerable to attack without knowing it. Despite the obvious benefits of cybersecurity another recently published report suggests that many UK companies aren’t in a position to finance it. Two thirds of UK firms claim to have experienced an attack in the last year, of which half were successful and a third costing the companies the equivalent of $240,000. Covid has been identified as a factor affecting cybersecurity, alongside a scarcity of the necessary expertise. These issues are given context by a recent cyberattack on a water treatment plant in the United States. In February 2021 the city of Oldsmar, Florida experienced a cyberattack on its water treatment system. The perpetrators managed to access the computer controlling drinking water chemicals and attempted to increase levels of sodium hydroxide to 11,100 parts per million (the normal amount is 100 ppm), which would’ve been toxic and damaging to human tissue. Fortunately the attack was thwarted, but only because an employee happened to observe suspicious cursor movement on a control screen. A second incident at another water treatment plant, this time in Kansas, USA resulted from a man allegedly logging into the Kansas public water system from home with the intention of shutting down safety processes which would have rendered the water unfit to drink. The man in question was an ex-employee of the Post Rock Water District facility, when the attack happened, in March 2019. These incidents highlight the importance of cyber-security in running critical infrastructure. It is suggested that companies review their IT security including IoT (internet of things) devices. &%23160;As more operations become digitally controlled, so might the risk of cyber-attack may increase. The Environment Agency currently does not require any indication that an operator’s IT systems meet cyber-security criteria. As more realised examples of cyber-attack emerge it is plausible that digital assurances of safety may become integral to permitting as physical assurances as the boundaries between digital and physical continue to blur.</p>",<p>https&%2358;//blogs.cisco.com/security/oldsmars-cyber-attack-raises-the-alarm-for-the-water-industry</p>,<p>Oldsmar’s cyber attack raises the alarm for the water industry</p>,Cisco,17/02/2021,"Maisl, F","<p>Exchange email hack&%2358; Hundreds of UK firms compromised%23%23<a href=""https&%2358;//www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-56365372"">https&%2358;//www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-56365372</a></p><p>A growing number of hackers are fighting back after their attacks are mitigated%23%23<a href=""https&%2358;//www.itproportal.com/news/a-growing-number-of-hackers-are-fighting-back-after-their-attacks-are-mitigated/"">https&%2358;//www.itproportal.com/news/a-growing-number-of-hackers-are-fighting-back-after-their-attacks-are-mitigated/</a></p><p>Many UK firms says they can't afford to stay safe against cyberattacks%23%23<a href=""https&%2358;//www.itproportal.com/news/many-uk-firms-says-they-cant-afford-to-stay-safe-against-cyberattacks/"">https&%2358;//www.itproportal.com/news/many-uk-firms-says-they-cant-afford-to-stay-safe-against-cyberattacks/</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/04/man-indicted-for-allegedly-tampering-with-computer-at-public-water-plant/"">Feds say man broke into public water system and shut down safety processes | Ars Technica</a></p>",information,Internet,,"disasters, accidents, risk",,1 - operational work,1 - realised,2 - credible,<p>incident regulation crime cyber-crime cyber-attack cyber-security water &quot;water treatment&quot; pollution chemical toxic health IT cost hack Microsoft &quot;counter incident response&quot; UK coronavirus Covid&%23160;Oldsmar&%23160;Florida &quot;sodium hydroxide&quot;&%23160; IOT &quot;internet of things&quot; computer internet data digital cyber-criminal permit Kansas workforce&%23160;</p>,No,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],18/05/2022 11:45,"Loveday, Tim",26/05/2021 16:16,"Loveday, Tim",0,,,,,Jason Dinsdale
15060,18/03/2021,Liisa Tang,<p>Connected lighting systems are emerging as a way to contribute to sustainability and green recovery and to digitalise societies but environment may be adversely impacted. </p>,"<p>Moving from traditional bulbs to LED for street lighting can bring both green recovery for achieving carbon neutrality and digital value, furthermore saving up to 40% of energy expenses and therefore is likely to become a key component of “smart city” initiatives. Conversely, the evidence points that the growth of LED lighting inevitably creates profound concerns about the impacts on the environment, especially grassland species including plants and animals, as raised by a study published by the University of Exeter. When the lights are dimmer or completely switched off between midnight and 4 am, grassland predatory spiders, among other species, are less affected. &%23160;Street light poles are not just for public lighting needs in urban areas but a method which provides an opportunity to make money out of it by leasing space, another step to digitalise societies. The LED lighting not only provides an energy efficient solution that can be programmed to dim or brighten as required but also has potential for &quot;smart&quot; lights that help site, campus or smart building management to maximise the use of the existing infrastructures. The vision of smart connected lighting networks has made urban lighting an asset for smart cities to use surveillance to collate and provide information that goes to the cloud and, for cities to compile and sell for profit. Sensors placed on streetlights can have assorted future applications from simple such as finding parking spaces for cars to environmental such as monitoring air quality or warn people of a storm approaching or of a need to evacuate. China, USA and India are leading the way globally as the connected lighting networks are predicted to become the main component of the smart city infrastructure.&%23160;</p>","<p class=""MsoPlainText""><u><a style=""color&%2358;%230563c1;text-decoration&%2358;underline;"" href=""https&%2358;//www.axios.com/smart-cities-street-lights-859992a6-6931-48e5-81ba-7f0a0b8058d9.html"">https&%2358;//www.axios.com/smart-cities-street-lights-859992a6-6931-48e5-81ba-7f0a0b8058d9.html</a></u></p>",The future of &quot;smart&quot; cities is in street lights,Axios,11/02/2021,"Kingson, J.A.","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.climatechangenews.com/2021/02/16/connected-lighting-systems-help-europe-meet-green-recovery-goals/""> Connected lighting systems could help Europe meet its green recovery goals (climatechangenews.com)</a></p> <p><a href=""https&%2358;//phys.org/news/2017-02-major-impact-wildlife.html"">https&%2358;//phys.org/news/2017-02-major-impact-wildlife.html</a></p> <p><a href=""https&%2358;//dot.ca.gov/-/media/dot-media/programs/research-innovation-system-information/documents/preliminary-investigations/assessing-the-impacts-of-led-lighting-to-wildlife-pi-a11y.pdf"">https&%2358;//dot.ca.gov/-/media/dot-media/programs/research-innovation-system-information/documents/preliminary-investigations/assessing-the-impacts-of-led-lighting-to-wildlife-pi-a11y.pdf</a></p> <p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.ecowatch.com/migratory-birds-philadelphia-2651099543.html?mc_cid=7fa1b45098&amp;mc_eid=61f523d301""> Philadelphia to Dim City Lights to Help Migratory Birds - EcoWatch</a></p>","trade, services",public service,lighting,"urban environment, urban stress",,2 - advisory work,3 - some development needed,2 - credible,<p>“smart cities” “street light poles“ “street lights” lighting “LED lights” LED “smart street lights“ luminaires sensors “lighting networks” landscapes urban streets cities harm “Light pollution” government technology energy “green recovery” energy carbon “energy efficiency” “digital technology” Signify surveillance intelligence data wildlife animals “grassland food-webs” “predatory invertebrates” spiders beetles “plant growth” “food webs”</p>,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],18/05/2022 11:45,"Loveday, Tim",26/05/2021 16:16,"Loveday, Tim",0,,,,,Liisa Tang

Metal oxides are good at storing information, but are less suited to transporting it. However magnetic oxides have shown the potential to move magnetic bits of information with little energy. At the nanoscale iron oxide (Fe2O3) contains magnetic whirls known as merons, which could be manipulated through passing an electric current through them. Thin layers of Iron oxide could therefore be manipulated electrically so they could be used as low-energy spintronics at room temperature.

15058,18/03/2021,Jason Dinsdale,"<p>The Governor of Nevada is laying the foundations for companies to establish their own administrative areas within the State, in exchange for investment.</p>","<p>Governor Steve Sisolak has outlined plans for technology companies in particular to construct “Innovation Zone” greenfield cities of at least 50,000 acres. &%23160;An Innovation Zone is defined as “a self-governing community, organised much like a traditional city or county but wholly focused on the development of innovative and advanced technologies”. Prospective applicants have to demonstrate they have a track record in advanced technology, and agree to initially &%23160;invest US$250 million, followed by a further US$1 billion over ten years. The governor would initially appoint a board to run the zone, but this would be replaced with an elected board over time as the zone grows and takes on responsibility for more local services, including taxes, schools and courts. One cryptocurrency magnate, Jeffrey Berns, CEO of Nevada-based Blockchains LLC, &%23160;is already interested in the proposal, envisaging a city where all payments, transactions, records and data are recorded on blockchain. The company already has plans &%23160;to break ground by 2022 and to build 15,000 homes and 33 million square feet (3 million square meters) of commercial and industrial space within 75 years. Berns believes that traditional government doesn’t offer enough flexibility to innovate and create a community where people can invent new uses for this technology. Some are oppposed to this programme due to the increased pressure it would put on state water resources, whilst at the same time removing responsibility from state authorities.&%23160;These proposals for Nevada echo the recent announcements by both the UK and Scottish Governments to establish Freeports and ‘Greenports’ (%23154).

They recently successfully created an OR switch in human cells. Previous biological OR gates were designed by combining two systems that responded separately to two different stimuli. The new OR switch is a true OR switch in that it is contained within a single system, in this case a DNA sequence. With further development the OR switch could find application in medical diagnostics and treatment. &%23160;This could lead to &%23160;artificially reprogrammed cells designed to perform medical tasks in our bodies, such as preserve or destroy cells based on their &%23160;genetic characteristics, e.g tumor cells. DNA has previously been shown to have promise as an efficient and durable data storage medium (%23****). Researchers in the USA have brought this realisation closer through developing an approach that converts digital electronic signals into genetic data stored in the genomes of living cells. Previous work had created a sensing module that responded to a ‘trigger’ sequence of DNA. Building on this the team incorporated a biosensor that responds to electrical signals. When an electric current was passed through a series of 24 cells containing bacteria, the trigger sequence levels were elevated, representing “1” and likewise the opposite to represent “0”. This represented a total of 72 bits, which were able to encode the message “hello world”. The configuration would require significant scale up beyond this proof of concept to be of true practical use. However storing data in this DNA form could mean cheaper to amplification or duplication through simply growing more cells. It also suggests the possibility of creating biocomputers through engineering cells’ DNA to perform logic and memory operations, and creating a direct interface between silicon and genomes that could mean direct reprogramming of cells. This could mean a proliferation of genetic modifications amongst other environmental implications.</div>",<p>https&%2358;//singularityhub.com/2021/01/11/new-research-could-enable-direct-data-transfer-from-computers-to-living-cells/</p>,<p>New research could enable direct data transfer from computers to living cells</p>,Singularity Hub,11/01/2021,"Gent, E","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.nature.com/articles/s41589-020-00711-4"">https&%2358;//www.nature.com/articles/s41589-020-00711-4</a></p> <p><a href=""https&%2358;//ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/eth-news/news/2021/03/cells-as-computers.html"">https&%2358;//ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/eth-news/news/2021/03/cells-as-computers.html</a></p> <p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247%2820%2931426-1"">https&%2358;//www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(20)31426-1</a></p>",biology1,DNA,,information,,4 - possible future remit,4 - signficant development needed,1 - Highly credible,<p>data computer silicon DNA biology cell biosensor logic OR gate switch regulation genetic energy efficiency information</p>,No,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],18/05/2022 11:45,"Loveday, Tim",26/05/2021 16:16,"Loveday, Tim",0,,,,,Jason Dinsdale

This evidence supports collaborative research across fields to find successful solutions to scientific problems and may lead to discovering potential of the same technique being adapted for crop plants to make them more resilient for growth in contaminated soil. The radioactive cesium that spreads to ecosystems after nuclear accidents has long term consequences due to the length of its half-life. But the newly discovered cesium transporters in plants are a significant development because they are potassium-independent, hence not hindering plant growth but able to remediate the soil and remove the toxic cesium using phytoremediation.

15052,10/03/2021,Becky LeAnstey,<p>Mining firms seek to electrify and decarbonise their facilities.</p>,"<div>Swedish state owned utility firm Vattenfall has signed a deal with an iron ore mining company on the Finnish border, forming a partnership to decarbonise mining operations. Vattenfall will use the development of their onshore wind projects to supply Kaunis Iron with renewable energy, so they can increase electrification of their mining operation and displace the use of fossil fuels. This is a significant development for an industry that has found it difficult to decarbonise due to the remote nature of many of their sites. It is not clear what part of the mining operation will undergo electrification yet as it is still early on in the planning process. This is the third fossil free project for Vattenfall, which is part of a consortium that is developing a site to produce ‘green steel’, and working with another mine to explore electrification of their mining and smelting. Developments to decarbonise mining and steelmaking are also in early stages in Germany with steel-maker Thyssenkrupp and the utility RWE, and Italy’s steel pipe facility Tenaris’s, which is exploring the use of hydrogen at their site. Economic viability will still need to be proved, but the partnership between utility firms and mining and or processing plants suggests that in the future industry could become based in hubs geographically where renewable energy such as wind is more readily available. This could have big implications for landscape and historic industrial inertia. Large scale movement of industry would not only have impacts on the way the Environment Agency regulates these new sites and processes, but would also result in significant resource being needed to ensure the planning is sympathetic to the local environments and biodiversity.</div>","<p><u><a style=""color&%2358;%230563c1;text-decoration&%2358;underline;"" href=""https&%2358;//www.rechargenews.com/transition/vattenfall-wants-wind-to-power-fossil-free-mining-project-in-sweden/2-1-942212"">https&%2358;//www.rechargenews.com/transition/vattenfall-wants-wind-to-power-fossil-free-mining-project-in-sweden/2-1-942212</a></u></p>",<p>Vattenfall wants wind to power fossil-free mining project in Sweden</p>,Recharge,11/01/2021,,,resources,mining,,energy,,1 - operational work,4 - signficant development needed,3 - less credible,<p>Mine energy renewable carbon decarbonisation wind solar industry planning biodiversity economics social steel chemical waste pollution transition hydrogen resource efficiency industrialisation industry utility electricity&%23160;</p>,No,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],18/05/2022 11:45,"Loveday, Tim",26/05/2021 16:16,"Loveday, Tim",0,,,,,Becky LeAnstey

15050,09/03/2021,Becky LeAnstey,<p>Investments that may finally drive the hydrogen economy.</p>,"<p>The hydrogen economy has been hailed as imminent for a number of years, however recent investments and projects suggests there may be some movement towards this aim. Seven of the largest hydrogen developers have formed a consortium called the Green Hydrogen Catapult initiative, which has the aim to drive down the costs of green hydrogen and increase the scale of production 50 fold in the next six years. Green hydrogen is formed using renewable energy to split water. It is different from grey and blue hydrogen which is produced using fossil fuels, but is currently cheaper. It is hoped this will help to speed up the move to a low carbon economy for hard to abate industries such as shipping, chemicals and steel. The consortium believe that if they can generate green hydrogen below $2/kg it will be the tipping point for the industry as it will become cost competitive against alternative fossil fuel technologies. In other developments, more than 30 countries now have hydrogen strategies, with £billions in investments already committed. The UK is looking at the feasibility of creating a hydrogen super hub port in Southampton, as well as industry initiatives looking at the use of hydrogen in the Zero Humber project. Although both would not involve green hydrogen initially, they could lead to technology advancements as they focus on carbon capture and storage. Sweden is aiming to open a ‘green steel’ production plant by 2024. This will be produced using green hydrogen as an alternative to coking coal. All this could have significant implications for the industries that the Environment Agency regulate, and how they may evolve around these hydrogen producing locations and hubs in the future.</p>","<p><a style=""color&%2358;%230563c1;text-decoration&%2358;underline;"" href=""https&%2358;//www.forbes.com/sites/mikescott/2020/12/14/green-hydrogen-the-fuel-of-the-future-set-for-50-fold-expansion/?sh=612576cb6df3"">https&%2358;//www.forbes.com/sites/mikescott/2020/12/14/green-hydrogen-the-fuel-of-the-future-set-for-50-fold-expansion/?sh=612576cb6df3</a></p>","<p>Green hydrogen, the fuel of the future, set for 50-fold expansion</p>",Forbes,14/12/2020,,"<p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.hydrogenfuelnews.com/hydrogen-super-hub/8541691/%20"">https&%2358;//www.hydrogenfuelnews.com/hydrogen-super-hub/8541691/ </a></p> <p><a href=""https&%2358;//newatlas.com/energy/h2gs-green-hydrogen-steel/%c2%a0%c2%a0%20"">https&%2358;//newatlas.com/energy/h2gs-green-hydrogen-steel/&%23160;&%23160; </a></p> <p><a href=""https&%2358;//newatlas.com/energy/hydrogen-council-insights/%20"">https&%2358;//newatlas.com/energy/hydrogen-council-insights/ </a></p> <p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.euractiv.com/section/politics/short_news/swedish-company-on-course-to-launch-worlds-first-carbon-free-steel/"">https&%2358;//www.euractiv.com/section/politics/short_news/swedish-company-on-course-to-launch-worlds-first-carbon-free-steel/</a></p>",energy,alternative fuel,,chemistry1,hydrogen,1 - operational work,4 - signficant development needed,3 - less credible,<p>'hydrogen economy' energy 'climate change' emissions fuel ammonia finance industry business technology renewable hydrogen steel waste pollution particulate coal 'fossil fuel'&%23160;&%23160;</p>,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],18/05/2022 11:45,"Loveday, Tim",26/05/2021 16:16,"Loveday, Tim",0,,,,,Becky LeAnstey
15049,09/03/2021,Jason Dinsdale,"<p>Increasing commercial activity in space could bring telecommunication opportunities, but may also bring with it environmental degradation - both terrestrial and celestial.&%23160;</p>","<p>It’s already well established that the planet has a growing space junk issue&%2358; millions of pieces of space debris orbit between 200 to 2,000 kilometres above the Earth’s surface, representing a threat to over 2,000 satellites that currently operating at low earth orbit (LEO). Researchers are now photographing the debris to help prevent collisions. However, some commercial space companies plan to greatly increase the number of satellites, placing thousands more into orbit over the next few years. One company at the forefront of this is Elon Musk’s SpaceX, which is establishing Starlink, a global network of satellite based high-speed internet. Starlink has permission to launch 11,943 satellites, and &%23160;hopes to deploy 4,425 satellites in orbit by 2024, and possibly 40,000 satellites in total. Other companies also have ambitions for this space, including Amazon. Pentago scientists have also been successful in beaming solar energy from space, via Photovoltaic Radiofrequency Antenna Module (PRAM) - similar projects have previously explored the same concept (%23****). Some commentators see parallels between these activities and a Wild West style ‘land grab’. &%23160; Some astronomers are concerned that a blanket of satellites and other objects could hamper observations. While Starlink has taken steps to reduce satellite ‘glare’ on observations, many satellites will remain above a critical brightness threshold, meaning that they could be seen with the naked eye. Light pollution is not a new environmental issue, but this new take on it also challenges notions of heritage and culture as well &%23160;as aesthetics and natural capital&%2358; losing the night sky for the sake of a technological convenience parallels other examples of losing a publicly available good to a luxury saleable item. Many nocturnal animals use the stars to navigate, including moths, frogs and migrating birds. Very little is currently known about how these animals integrate and interpret celestial cues. It is unclear if introducing multiple bright objects to the night sky could impact on these natural processes. There is no doubt a balance between technological utility and environmental protection, as with all emerging technologies&%2358; there may therefore be a role for the Environment Agency and its partners to factor in approaches and technologies in the upper atmosphere into wider environmental systems analyses.</p>",<p>https&%2358;//theconvivialsociety.substack.com/p/what-did-we-lose-when-we-lost-the</p>,<p>What did we lose when we lost the stars?</p>,The Convivial Society,29/01/2021,"Sacasas, L.M","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//edition.cnn.com/2021/02/23/americas/space-solar-energy-pentagon-science-scn-intl/index.html"">https&%2358;//edition.cnn.com/2021/02/23/americas/space-solar-energy-pentagon-science-scn-intl/index.html</a></p> <p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.cnbc.com/2021/02/09/spacexs-starlink-accepting-99-preorders-as-musk-considers-ipo.html"">https&%2358;//www.cnbc.com/2021/02/09/spacexs-starlink-accepting-99-preorders-as-musk-considers-ipo.html</a></p> <p><a href=""https&%2358;//interestingengineering.com/elon-musk-promised-starlink-internet-speed-1-gbps"">https&%2358;//interestingengineering.com/elon-musk-promised-starlink-internet-speed-1-gbps</a></p> <p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/images-of-space-debris/9760/"">https&%2358;//www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/images-of-space-debris/9760/</a></p> <p><a href=""https&%2358;//uk.pcmag.com/networking/130552/amazons-satellite-internet-service-starts-to-take-shape-with-antenna-prototype"">https&%2358;//uk.pcmag.com/networking/130552/amazons-satellite-internet-service-starts-to-take-shape-with-antenna-prototype</a></p> <p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.businessinsider.com/arianespace-ceo-elon-musk-colonize-low-earth-orbit-2019-11?r=US&amp;IR=T"">https&%2358;//www.businessinsider.com/arianespace-ceo-elon-musk-colonize-low-earth-orbit-2019-11?r=US&amp;IR=T</a></p> <p><a href=""http&%2358;//www.sci-news.com/biology/nocturnal-animals-stars-orientation-05775.html"">http&%2358;//www.sci-news.com/biology/nocturnal-animals-stars-orientation-05775.html</a></p> <p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5805938/"">https&%2358;//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5805938/</a></p>",space,artificial satellite,,"natural areas, landscape, ecosystems",natural heritage assessment,3 - influencing role,2 - near to realisation,3 - less credible,<p>space &quot;natural capital&quot; celestial satellite &quot;Elon Musk&quot; Starlink Amazon &quot;low earth orbit&quot; LEO telecommunication internet light pollution star nature biodiversity migration navigation bird frog moth seal beetle astronomy earth observation solar energy&%23160;common goods technology regulation impact assessment ecosystem &quot;Photovoltaic Radiofrequency Antenna Module&quot; (PRAM) Pentagon energy defence</p>,No,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],18/05/2022 11:45,"Loveday, Tim",26/05/2021 16:16,"Loveday, Tim",0,,,,,Jason Dinsdale
15048,09/03/2021,Becky LeAnstey,<p>Perovskite is a promising new compound for use in solar panels and other industrial technologies.</p>,"<p>Current efficiency of solar panels averages around 20%, incorporating perovskite offers the potential of achieving 29%. The costs associated with solar power generation have already dropped significantly over the last decade, so that in many cases it is currently cheaper than the fossil fuel equivalents. Increasing the efficiency of solar panels is only likely to increase this trend. However developments in energy storage will also need to be made to harness the energy generated for use in times of low sunlight and when other renewable technologies are not generating. Perovskite is a naturally occurring mineral, but can also be a synthetic compound with a similar chemical structure. As well as being of interest for solar generation, the compound has characteristic that mean it is of interest for use in the telecommunications and microelectronics sectors as well. It can be generated cheaply and easily, which means that industry is increasingly exploring how to commercialise its use. Some research on the toxicity of breakdown materials from solar cells containing perovskite suggest that aquatic toxicity could be a problem due to the other compounds associated with its use. It is believed that with proper end of life planning, this toxicity can be mitigated. As perovskite becomes increasingly incorporated into other products, the Environment agency may wish to engage with industry now to ensure end of life policies are put in place to make sure it does not become a pollutant of the future. &%23160;&%23160;</p>",<p>https&%2358;//www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/solar-power-world-record-perovskite-b1774312.html</p>,<p>Solar power world record set with miracle material Perovskite</p>,The Independent,15/12/2020,,"<p><a href=""https&%2358;//actu.epfl.ch/news/game-changer-perovskite-can-detect-gamma-rays/"">https&%2358;//actu.epfl.ch/news/game-changer-perovskite-can-detect-gamma-rays/</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.nature.com/articles/s41893-020-00645-8"">https&%2358;//www.nature.com/articles/s41893-020-00645-8</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-37229-8"">https&%2358;//www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-37229-8</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2515-7655/ab5eee"">https&%2358;//iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2515-7655/ab5eee</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/perovskites"">https&%2358;//www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/perovskites</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-01/dnal-fgo010421.php"">https&%2358;//www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-01/dnal-fgo010421.php</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/12/201210145817.htm"">https&%2358;//www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/12/201210145817.htm</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/eliminating-the-dangers-posed-by-lead-in-perovskite-solar-cells/13234/"">Eliminating&%23160;the&%23160;dangers posed by lead&%23160;in perovskite solar cells (innovationnewsnetwork.com)</a></p>",energy,solar energy technology,,materials,,1 - operational work,2 - near to realisation,2 - credible,<p>solar waste treatment&%23160;'circular economy' energy power carbon toxic toxicity pollution electricity remediation recycling recycle material compound metal efficiency renewable&%23160;&%23160;</p>,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],18/05/2022 11:45,"Loveday, Tim",26/05/2021 16:16,"Loveday, Tim",0,,,,,Becky LeAnstey
15047,04/03/2021,Jason Dinsdale,<p>Some companies in the UK and elsewhere are starting to experiment with limitless leave for their employees.&%23160;</p>,"<p>The philosophy for the companies involved is that as working for them is a privilege rather than a punishment then taking time off is not a reward. Advocates of the system note that employees continue to take modest amounts of leave, and employers recognise that the system is an indication of trust in their staff. Such an arrangement may not suit larger companies or be favoured by HR departments. However flexible working arrangements adopted during the coronavirus pandemic have proven popular with workers, with many not wishing to return to the office full time. With this has had to come an increased trust in staff, and a shift along from ‘working at home’ to ‘living at work’. The new found flexibility and trust could mean that the HR landscape is potentially more receptive to new ideas around working arrangements. For some non UK nationals an increased flexibility could mean prolonged periods of working remotely overseas whilst visiting family. Staff with few domestic responsibilities could similarly wish to work from outside of the UK for extended periods of time, and outside of Uk time zones. Management may be unwilling to adopt such a policy. IT security issues may hinder people working from outside of UK infrastructure. Ultimately not adapting limitless leave may mean that people look for employment elsewhere that has greater flexibility. These are just some of the possible consequences. The Environment Agency continues to support flexible working and wishes to be a life affirming place to work - limitless leave may therefore promote these values further.</p>",<p>https&%2358;//www.destination-innovation.com/an-innovative-hr-policy-to-attract-staff-unlimited-vacation/</p>,<p>An innovative HR policy to attract staff - unlimited vacation!</p>,Destination Innovation,04/03/2021,"Sloane, P",,economics1,employment,,"social aspects, population",,1 - operational work,4 - signficant development needed,3 - less credible,<p>employment workforce leave UK overseas coronavirus &quot;remote working&quot; home working employee management &quot;human relations&quot; IT security foreign recruitment Covid-19</p>,No,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],18/05/2022 11:45,"Loveday, Tim",26/05/2021 16:16,"Loveday, Tim",0,,,,,Jason Dinsdale

Other oil companies have made similar commitments to reducing fossil fuel extraction for climate change related reasons. Changing attitudes to investment in oil and gas may also partly be a factor. This is exemplified by Norway’s $1.3 trillion sovereign wealth fund which recently announced that it was to take a critical look at its holdings in oil and gas from an ethical, rather than an economic perspective, also declaring that oil holdings had underperformed next to holdings in other stocks such as technology companies.<br>And in the USA an auction for oil rights for drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge generated no interest from major oil companies who are focusing their spending on renewable energy, amid a huge slump in oil prices, in part triggered by the coronavirus pandemic. The lack of interest may also have been linked to the prospect of Joe Biden becoming president&%2358; Mr Biden has since signed executive orders to ban new oil and gas permits on public land, including the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Together these events could suggest that large corporations with oil interests currently are moving into alternative and ‘greener’ sources of revenue. However oil and gas demand may remain for decades to come, suggesting significant changes to business models involving carbon capture and storage and off-setting, or newer, smaller companies coming into the operating space, which may not have the same business models or reputational concerns as established energy companies.

15037,18/02/2021,Jason Dinsdale,Japan has set out its intentions towards ammonia fuel for the next decade. ,"<div>Japan has previously set ambitious goals for becoming a hydrogen economy (%23*****), to which ammonia could make a significant contribution as an energy storage medium. The Japanese government aims to boost the country’s demand for ammonia fuel to three million tonnes by 2030, creating a new supply chain in a bid to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and contribute to the country’s ambitions in this space - previously Japan has claimed that it is certain to reach carbon neutrality by 2050. Japan currently uses 1.08 million tonnes of ammonia for fertiliser and industrial materials, 80% of which is produced locally. They will have to increase this to 3 million tonnes a year by 2030, which means establishing an international supply chain. They also hope that unit prices will also reduce as imports increase to 30 million tonnes by 2050. Japan’s biggest power generator JERA plans to pilot an ammonia fuel mix at its coal-fired power plants, becoming mainstream by 2035. It should be noted that if all of Japan’s coal-fired plants use ammonia for 20% of their fuel source the volume of ammonia needed would equate to the World’s current trade volume per year, demonstrating the ambition in this plan. Japan hopes to export the technology it develops through embracing ammonia fuel, which may in turn lead to greater adoption in other parts of the World. However, the energy intensive nature of ammonia production would also imply that green ammonia production would be a key part of this strategy. Greater uptake also implies a greater regulatory role for the Environment Agency as ammonia is an air pollutant of note for its environmental impacts.</div>

Scientists have discovered that algae compressed together in water droplets produce hydrogen instead of oxygen through natural photosynthesis.Because there isn’t sufficient oxygen atoms for photosynthesis to occur, hydrogen-yielding enzymes take over instead.While still in very early stages the discovery could be refined to improve hydrogen fuel cells and ultimately create an environmentally benign approach to hydrogen production. Another project has led to a faster, cleaner, one step process that converts plastic into clean hydrogen that could be used as fuel. Plastic pieces were broken down with catalysts of iron oxide and aluminum oxide. The mixture was then heated in a microwave, leading to the plastics releasing 97 per cent of their hydrogen molecules in mere seconds, leaving a residue consisting of mainly carbon nanotubes, which could have commercial value. The experiment used only 300 grams of plastic, so is not yet at a stage for commercial use. However the realisation of such a process at an industrial scale could have implications for waste management and emissions to air, and is therefore relevant to the Environment Agency.<br>&%23160;</p></div>","<div class=""ExternalClass472AC93D6773439D97F74D3F1E9D7CAF""><p>https&%2358;//interestingengineering.com/scientists-turn-plastic-into-hydrogen-by-microwaving-it</p></div>",<div>Scientists turn plastic into hydrogen by microwaving It</div>,Interesting Engineering,14/10/2020,"Lang, F","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.nature.com/articles/s41929-020-00518-5.epdf"">https&%2358;//www.nature.com/articles/s41929-020-00518-5.epdf</a></p> <p><a href=""https&%2358;//futurism.com/the-byte/living-factories-churn-hydrogen-fuel"">https&%2358;//futurism.com/the-byte/living-factories-churn-hydrogen-fuel</a></p> <p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19823-5"">https&%2358;//www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19823-5</a></p>",energy,algae-based biofuel production,,resources,waste use,1 - operational work,4 - signficant development needed,1 - Highly credible,,No,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],18/05/2022 11:45,"Loveday, Tim",26/05/2021 16:16,"Loveday, Tim",0,,,,,Jason Dinsdale

The significance to Environment Agency is that fungal materials have interesting qualities such as sustainability, durability, reparability and adaptability and as 21% of carbon dioxide emissions come from the making of steel and concrete, fungal materials could enable the move away from concrete. The research provides critical evidence for a potential to radically rethink architecture and construction industry; perhaps even move away from the permanence of our buildings to be shorter term and then finally recycled. Fungal materials can be used to create small modules such as bricks, as isolation materials between the walls and are useful because they can repair damage and behave in a self-healing manner. Fungi as construction material combines embedded artificial intelligence with eco-friendliness, low repair costs and eventually recycling of all materials. But this can be taken one step further, as NASA is exploring ways to build bases for human settlement on the Moon and Mars. The researchers found that mycelium networks are capable of information processing similar to computers and can sense and process environmental stimuli, for instance light, temperature, electrical signals and presence of chemical substances. This biosensor property can be utilised in producing textiles and smart biowearable devices such as mobile phones or growing fungi largescale to monitor an entire ecosystem.</p></div>","<div class=""ExternalClass91BDC39D2C1C41A9B08A20C938350B8F""><p><u><a style=""color&%2358;%230563c1;text-decoration&%2358;underline;"" href=""https&%2358;//www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-01/uodc-fwa011821.php"">https&%2358;//www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-01/uodc-fwa011821.php</a></u></p></div>",<div>Fungal wearables and devices&%2358; biomaterials pave the way towards science fiction-like future</div>,EurekAlert!,18/01/2021,UNIVERSITAT OBERTA DE CATALUNYA (UOC),"<p><a href=""https&%2358;//horizon.scienceblog.com/1580/why-future-homes-could-be-made-of-living-fungus/"">https&%2358;//horizon.scienceblog.com/1580/why-future-homes-could-be-made-of-living-fungus/</a></p> <p><a href=""http&%2358;//dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystems.2020.104304"">http&%2358;//dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystems.2020.104304</a></p> <p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/w3cszv6v"">https&%2358;//www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/w3cszv6v</a></p> <p><a href=""https&%2358;//interestingengineering.com/fungi-leather-an-environmentally-friendly-alternative%20%c2%a0"">https&%2358;//interestingengineering.com/fungi-leather-an-environmentally-friendly-alternative &%23160;</a></p> <p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.dezeen.com/2020/10/08/mylo-consortium-adidas-stella-mccartney-lululemon-kering-mycelium/%20"">https&%2358;//www.dezeen.com/2020/10/08/mylo-consortium-adidas-stella-mccartney-lululemon-kering-mycelium/ </a></p> <p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.techthatmatters.com/this-vegan-leather-made-from-cactus-is-a-genuinely-green-alternative/"">https&%2358;//www.techthatmatters.com/this-vegan-leather-made-from-cactus-is-a-genuinely-green-alternative/</a></p> <p><a href=""https&%2358;//environmentjournal.online/articles/worlds-first-as-fungi-to-be-used-as-smart-building-material/"">https&%2358;//environmentjournal.online/articles/worlds-first-as-fungi-to-be-used-as-smart-building-material/</a></p> <p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.fungar.eu/"">https&%2358;//www.fungar.eu/</a></p>",biology1,mycete,fungus,materials,,3 - influencing role,4 - signficant development needed,2 - credible,"<div class=""ExternalClass34C6A61841AA4391B751559F15E69360""><p>Fungi fungus Mycelium Mycete “oyster fungus” “Pleurotus ostreatus” Basidiomycetes &%23160;mushroom materials “alternative material” “construction material” construction building “intelligent buildings” “mycelium buildings” “building material” &quot;fungal architectures&quot; FUNGAR “living architecture” “natural material” fabrics textiles wearables biowearables “smart wearables” “fungal wearables” biotechnology biosensing biosensor “unconventional computing” Adamatzky “fungal computers” networks “Mycelium network” “mycelial network” mycolite mycology biophysics &quot;slime mould&quot;</p></div>",Yes,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],18/05/2022 11:45,"Loveday, Tim",26/05/2021 16:16,"Loveday, Tim",0,,,,,Liisa Tang

As the future of farming, especially precision farming, is increasingly becoming automated and traditional methods are replaced by Artificial Intelligence, there is apprehension among researchers and farmers that smaller farms cannot afford AI or robotics and hence will not be able to keep up with the bigger ones, leading to socio-equity questions. There are fears about security and cyber-attacks to hack AI systems, robotics intensifying agriculture further to the detriment of biodiversity, robot welfare eventually dominating animal welfare, and prospective centralisation of ownership in agriculture. Therefore public concerns must be addresses and consideration must be given to the social and political impacts from this change.

The next stage of the research is to investigate whether Geobacter could also be used in a similar way to absorb cadmium, another toxic metal that is associated with industrial pollution.

The significance to Environment Agency is that as circular economy is built on renewable materials, it seems an inefficient policy to consider excavated soils from construction sites as waste, especially as 80 per cent of the soils are not contaminated in any way but could be utilised somewhere else. Soils from construction sites are the largest source of waste in volume produced in Europe yet governments are only now realising what a major issue this is, requiring urgent attention. In most countries in Europe the soils in question equal five times the volume of all household waste. There could be a launch of a national database to ensure a better traceability system and in order to promote circular economy, particularly as it could potentially be very cost-effective at construction sites, cutting down waste transport needs. Moving to low carbon cement for construction needs is not enough but by addressing excavated soils and their reuse and transport construction companies can save approximately 7-8% in carbon costs.<br></p></div>","<div class=""ExternalClass5CB5022644724381AB2935E1C2D7F424""><p>https&%2358;//www.euractiv.com/section/circular-economy/news/excavated-soils-the-biggest-source-of-waste-youve-never-heard-of/</p></div>",<div>Excavated soils&%2358; The biggest source of waste you’ve never heard of</div>,EurekAlert!,13/01/2021,"Simon, F.",,industry1,building industry,,soil,,1 - operational work,1 - realised,2 - credible,"<div class=""ExternalClass41CF16CC8BD8452FABE94347E7932F43""><p>soil soils &quot;excavated soils&quot; waste &quot;waste source&quot; construction building industry industrial “circular economy” &quot;circular use&quot; sustainability carbon “soil management” cement landfills disposal contamination &quot;contaminated soils&quot; &quot;disposal of construction waste&quot;</p></div>",Yes,Yes,No,No,No,,,,,,[],18/05/2022 11:45,"Loveday, Tim",26/05/2021 16:16,"Loveday, Tim",0,,,,,Liisa Tang

The interest for Environment Agency is that public agencies tend to choose materials based on short-term costs of road construction and filling potholes rather than environmental concerns and considerable reduction in emissions and pollutants, and long-term costs including road maintenance. This tendency acts as a barrier to reducing environmental impacts originating from roads, highways and pavements.</p><p>The developments in road materials means substituting conventional materials such as limestone aggregate or adding recycled materials such as plastics or powdered glass into the mix. This change alters the characteristics of pavements such as stiffness, reflectivity and porosity, composition and stiffness, with varying implications to behaviour, road wear and traffic. Paved surface emit organic pollutant compounds especially during hot weather, and hot sunny days will increase with climate change.

The relevance to Environment Agency is that this could be used not only for soil monitoring but also potentially in incident management and soil remediation work. This novel technology can give us a great deal of information about the below-ground environment of plants and soil characteristics and interactions, such as roots growth, water properties and soil microbiome.<br>The robots are one to two foot long and as they burrow into the ground, they copy the wriggling movement of earthworms as they move, creating an underground tunnel. As they move, integrated sensors take measurements of temperature and humidity, recording the data ready to download when returned to the surface. As they burrow, they already can collate data on soil density and compactness. Fibre optic cable can take images of roots and record micro-organism activity and measure carbon compounds released by plant roots.<br>The project is currently focused on maize crops, testing the robots along the planted rows, to collect data on how the roots grow, since root growth is a key indicator in understanding how plants adapt to water availability and hence enhances understanding or corn plants’ stress tolerance, how they cope with drought and other effects of climate change.

The prospect of contracting the virus from unknown others who may not be visibly symptomatic has radically altered the way we approach previously unquestioned spaces, changing and limiting their ability to fulfil the functions for which they were designed. In this way the hither too unconsidered ways in which the built environment assumes and requires a level of immunity to the micro-biological world around us has been drawn out and exposed for all to see. The resulting juxtaposition of the need to ‘get on’ with our everyday lives with the need for us to remain safe has opened up a new space for innovation that is re-working how indoor spaces are arranged and function. In east London entrepreneur Xu Weiping has created an indoor office comprised of individual 3 x 3 metre cubes that ‘contain’ each employee by removing the need for them to move around. Each space contains its own toilet and basic kitchenette, as well as workspace, so the range of needs an office normally fulfils can be serviced individually. At the same time the Arrival bus company has designed a modular interior for one of its new electric models, allowing its internal space to be flexibly re-organised to accommodate social distancing. In South Korea a new bus shelter is being made safe by technology that takes the temperature of entrants, and refuses access to anybody with an abnormally high reading. This developing trajectory in indoor space innovation is important to the EA as an employer with its own office spaces, and a proportion of employees who may rely on public transport to get to work.</div>","<div class=""ExternalClass3138B45E3545444F85B22FE1B6103E3E"">https&%2358;//www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/13/south-korea-installs-anti-virus-bus-shelters-with-temperature-sensors-and-uv-lamps<br>&%23160;</div>",<div>South Korea installs anti-virus bus shelters with temperature sensors and UV lamps</div>,The Guardian,13/08/2020,Agence France-Presse,"<p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.theguardian.com/business/2020/aug/13/office-pods-may-be-the-answer-to-working-safely-post-covid-19"">https&%2358;//www.theguardian.com/business/2020/aug/13/office-pods-may-be-the-answer-to-working-safely-post-covid-19</a></p>","social aspects, population",Human health,behavioural change,building,,1 - operational work,2 - near to realisation,2 - credible,"<div class=""ExternalClassE4233D4C66354FB4A0A895235E983BF6"">“public spaces” &quot;indoor spaces&quot; construction work transport “working environment“ “human health” outbreak virus “post-Covid” “self-containment” sensors “anti-coronavirus measures” epidemic sensors temperature disinfection detector facilities</div>",No,Yes,No,No,No,,"social aspects, population",Human health,transport,building,[],18/05/2022 11:45,"Loveday, Tim",26/05/2021 16:16,"Loveday, Tim",0,,,,,SJB/Liisa Tang

15012,06/01/2021,SJB/Liisa Tang,Technological innovations are making farming smarter for crop production and livestock monitoring via wireless sensors.,"<div class=""ExternalClass2BF8DF55230E46D9BFE7D3A78F755B6F"">Researchers and engineers from different disciplines are producing technological innovations that could lead to improvements in farming methods and, as a consequence, increased resource efficiency. Collectively these developments are being termed ‘precision farming’. They’re important to the EA because they could eventually lead to reduced agricultural demand for water and application of water polluting substances, such as fertiliser. In one example a collective of European farmers is working alongside technologists to introduce smart sensors onto their farms. The sensors have multiple uses, one of which is being attached to the ears of dairy cattle. When used in conjuction with automated feeding systems they can enable famers to identify when each cow feeds and the exact quantity of nutrients it takes in. Preliminary data points to improved diets and, in turn, a greater quality and quantity of milk production as a result. A second set of sensors are being attached to crop plants to monitor their immediate environmental conditions and health. Where a crop is lacking nutrients, water, or any other required resource, farmers can be alerted quickly and shown exactly where deficiencies lie in the field. They then need to use less resource to resolve the problem than they otherwise might have done using a less targeted approach.  <br>Separately from the sensors, agronomists are also making advances in understanding how crop planting patterns can impact yield. In a large meta-study of available evidence, researchers in north-eastern China determined that uniform spatial planting patterns have the potential to result in improved crop yields and reduced weed production. At the moment crops are kept fairly uniform distances apart between rows, but within each row seeds can fall randomly resulting in a mix of patterns. However, when instead they are placed at equal distances apart along a row, to form a grid pattern, average crop yields rise by 20%. Average weed production in several studies also fell by 30%. The implication is that the same amount of crop could eventually be raised on less land, using less water and other treatments. <br></div>","<div class=""ExternalClass816650C995394375B23EEF8AE95B1047"">https&%2358;//phys.org/news/2020-05-crop-animal-sensors-farming-smarter.html</div>",<div>How crop and animal sensors are making farming smarter</div>,PhysOrg.com,18/05/2020,"Gray, R.","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//phys.org/news/2020-03-environmental-footprint-california-dairy-cows.html"">Study examines environmental footprint of California dairy cows over 50 years (phys.org)</a></p>",agriculture,animal husbandry,animal production,animal husbandry,cattle,2 - advisory work,2 - near to realisation,2 - credible,"<div class=""ExternalClass980E28401B3C4D1C80D0BCA8B980752F"">agriculture information data “cloud-based system” sensors “smart sensors” “sensor network” “smart agriculture” livestock dairy “livestock tracking” monitoring diet “animal health” “plant health”  AI “artificial intelligence” “arable crops” “crop production” “crop yields”</div>",Yes,Yes,No,No,No,,agriculture,information,resources,"food, drinking water",[],18/05/2022 11:45,"Loveday, Tim",26/05/2021 16:16,"Loveday, Tim",0,,,,,SJB/Liisa Tang

Currently operators are required to pay a launch fee designed to dis-incentivise unnecessary entry into space, but once in orbit operators have no further incentive to return their craft to earth or dispose of it properly. To address this gap a new orbital use fee is proposed – charging operators on the basis of the continued occupation of an orbit. If the craft is abandoned in orbit as debris then the charges continue. The proposal points to the continued development of space as a used and valued part of our environment. In doing so opens up a range of questions for the EA around the role it should be playing in developing the regulatory framework for use and protection of the space environment.

They analysed an array of data from satellites, research aircraft, drones, remote sensors and the geospatial sensors on modern combine harvesters to determine the variables most strongly associated with reduced yields. They found that the position of a crop within the landscape and the soil type it was growing in were key. Micro variations in terrain like depressions, summits and slopes determined how water moved through a crop and were associated with two-thirds of the zones of ‘unstable’ yield production identified. The findings are being presented in the form of yield stability maps that can be used to inform local adaptive practices.

The availability of future water resources is a top priority for the Environment Agency, including in its capacity as a regulator of the water industry. Water loss through leaks in the pipe network accounts for a substantial proportion total water consumed and reducing it is therefore a priority cross the sector. At the moment leaks are detectable through a system of pressure gauges along the pipes, but being able to precisely identify the location of a leak is a barrier to being able to deal with it in a timely and economic manner. Operators often use what are termed ‘hammer tests’ to narrow down their location. The flow in a pipe is abruptly halted and the resulting shock wave is monitored as it propagates back up through the pipe. Statistical techniques are then used to interpret the data and narrow down the possible area the leak could be in. At the moment that’s a slow computational process conducted by computers and accuracy is a problem. To improve it statisticians at Stanford have now developed a Bayesian approach that both improves the accuracy of the end results and significantly reduces the amount of computational time required to get there.

Where current solar energy generation takes place in rigid cells that are cumbersome and fragile, quantum dots can simply be printed on to different types of surface, including flexible ones. Technology of this sort could eventually hold the potential to drive a radical shift in energy generation, away from central or even local power stations, towards a device centric arrangement.

But in recent months Mark Zuckerberg has signalled a shift in Facebook’s posture towards regulators on the international stage. His comments point towards a stance of cooperation with European officials who have concerns around the impact of social media on the blocks democratic and market processes. Facebook’s position frames the issue in terms of competing international models of regulation, notably with China. Inherent in these discussions is the acceptance that an international system of online regulation is now both necessary and that different visions of what it should look like are already under construction.

The potential use of this biomimicry development for Environment Agency could be in enforcement work and odour monitoring, or monitoring anything of interest to us that has a smell; and to use a camera on the drone to survey location. Original applications listed were uses for detection of gas leaks, explosive materials, locating people after natural disasters.<br>Once the antennae are separated from a live moth they are functional for up to four hours and potentially longer after being refrigerated. Tiny wires are added to the antennae in order to connect to an electrical circuit, to record the responses made, and then these antennae with sensors are attached to a standard drone, adding plastic fins to the back to create drag so that the drone would be facing upwind to maximise smelling opportunities. Researchers created a search protocol for the drone and when the required threshold of smelling is reached, it moves towards the detected source.

It could represent a solution to power generation during coastal flooding incidents, and may provide a cost efficient alternative to marine solar and wind renewables without taking valuable land out of action. OTEC works through utilising the temperature difference between warmer surface water and cold water at depth. The warmer water is vapourised to make a “working fluid” with a low boiling point, which drives a turbine. This is then cooled by water drawn from lower in the water column, before returning to the boiler to complete the cycle. For every 2.5MW of energy generated, 1.5MW can be captured as electricity – with the “lost” energy used to keep the system running. While other OTEC projects exist (%23*****) in this particular project all the energy capture takes place offshore, so little land needs to be converted to infrastructure in support.

UV-absorbing pigment increased in flowers with exposed pollen, but decreased in flowers with closed pollen, thought to be an attempt to prevent overheating of the closed pollen. The changes in UV pigment, and indeed further changes in pigmentation could have an impact on reproduction, which relies on pollination by insects such as bees. Insects are thought to be attracted to the contrasting UV hues between lighter petals and darker centres. Flowers with rising UV levels may lose this contrast and be missed by pollinators entirely. This new development adds to pressures of habitat loss and pollution, could impact on the viability of crops and food security, and is therefore of interest to the Environment Agency and partners.</div>","<div><a href=""https&%2358;//theswaddle.com/flowers-are-changing-colors-to-adapt-to-rising-temperatures-declining-ozone/"">https&%2358;//theswaddle.com/flowers-are-changing-colors-to-adapt-to-rising-temperatures-declining-ozone/</a> &%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;&%23160;<font color=""black""><a href=""https&%2358;//www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822%2820%2931267-7"">https&%2358;//www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(20)31267-7</a></font></div>","<div>Flowers are changing colors to adapt to rising temperatures, declining ozone</div>",Error - action required,29/09/2020,,,agriculture,climate change adaptation,adaptive capacity,agriculture,,2 - advisory work,1 - realised,1 - Highly credible,"<div class=""ExternalClassFE4317CAA21E49A4B1418755682D3C7A"">&quot;Climate change&quot; biodiversity ozone flower plant &quot;ultraviolet light&quot; UV pigment temperature farming agriculture crop pollination insect bee &quot;food security&quot; habitat pollution regulation</div>",Yes,Yes,No,No,No,,agriculture,Climate change,Biodiversity,farming,[],18/05/2022 11:45,"Loveday, Tim",26/05/2021 16:15,"Loveday, Tim",0,,,,,Jason Dinsdale
14995,15/12/2020,Jason Dinsdale,"Innovations in personal protective equipment, some of which have evolved in response to the coronavirus pandemic, suggest future impacts on workforce health safety and wellbeing (HSW).","<div class=""ExternalClass7E655C09845D4E78A02EB3D2918DF2EE"">The Environment Agency prioritises HSW and therefore should be interested in the potential opportunities and issues that these may present. A new study has assessed the level of workplace interruptions on stress biological stress, rather than productivity and performance. An experiment suggested that workers with frequent interruptions from emails, messages and colleagues had up to twice the levels of cortisol in their system than the control. However the workers didn’t perceive their heightened stress level - they reported being less stressed than the control. The results of this study are providing the basis for developing a digital early warning system team  that uses machine learning to detect and pre-​empt stress in the workplace in real time. A new virtual reality (VR) headset takes a similar direction, monitoring the users eye movement, face and lip movement, pupil size and heart rate. Algorithms will monitor this data to infer behaviour, attention and cognitive load, such as how overwhelming a task could be to someone. VR is expected to grow in prevalence in the workplace, there may be an expectation to adopt similar monitoring for HSW reasons. A new exosuit takes a less digital approach to improving physical HSW. It  employs low-profile, elastic assistive forces to compliment back strength of the user. This could be of benefit to field workers who stand for long hours, but could equally be of use desk workers who regularly have to move around or pick up objects. The suit can reduce muscle fatigue up to 47 per cent. A company called Microclimate has designed a lightweight helmet with HEPA filters attached for use when travelling by air. The helmet’s filters can remove 99.97 per cent of particles as small as 0.03 micros, using two high-powered fans to pull air through and keep the mask free of fog and users safe from airborne contaminants. The helmet seals around the neck rather than the face, so it doesn’t interfere with facial expression. Two different research teams have been using vocal analysis to diagnose a range of symptoms, including coronavirus. A team at MIT developed an artificial intelligence (AI) powered framework that had used a learning algorithm to detect possible signs of dementia voice recordings. The team applied their framework to helping tackle the coronavirus pandemic and found a correlation strong enough to suggest that it could detect Covid-19 even in otherwise asymptomatic patients. A voice analysis company called Vocalis have previously developed an app that could detect flare-ups of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease by listening for signs that users were short of breath when speaking. They applied their algorithms to recordings of voice samples from people testing positive for Covid-19. The resulting tool can’t provide a definite diagnosis, but it can be used to screen for people most in need of quarantine or treatment. Others are using vocal biomarkers to screen for a range of neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinsons. While this field is still developing, analysis of voice through phone calls etc could provide a way to detect a range of illnesses early, including mental health issues including depression. All of these technologies provide a way to enhance health safety and wellbeing of staff. However many of them also rely on a trade-off with employee privacy (including contractors) to be effective, which could be met with resistance from individuals and also demographics who have differing attitudes to data privacy. Policies may need adapting now in anticipation of increased collection and use of biometric data and physical enhancement technologies.</div>","<div class=""ExternalClassA718CC2AADCB42399C3E80EA40D32814"">https&%2358;//www.cnet.com/news/hps-face-tracking-heart-rate-enabled-vr-headset-aims-to-measure-digital-fatigue/%23ftag=CAD590a51e<br><br>&%23160;</div>",<div>Artificial intelligence model detects asymptomatic Covid-19 infections through cellphone-recorded coughs</div>,CNET,29/10/2020,,"<p><a href=""https&%2358;//interestingengineering.com/new-exosuit-against-muscle-fatigue-is-set-to-change-work-habits"">https&%2358;//interestingengineering.com/new-exosuit-against-muscle-fatigue-is-set-to-change-work-habits</a></p> <p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-72531-4"">https&%2358;//www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-72531-4</a></p> <p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.designboom.com/design/air-microclimate-helmet-hepa-filter-10-01-2020/"">https&%2358;//www.designboom.com/design/air-microclimate-helmet-hepa-filter-10-01-2020/</a></p> <p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02732-4"">https&%2358;//www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02732-4</a></p> <p><a href=""https&%2358;//ethz.ch/content/main/en/news-and-events/eth-news/news/2020/10/workplace-interruptions-lead-to-physical-stress.html"">https&%2358;//ethz.ch/content/main/en/news-and-events/eth-news/news/2020/10/workplace-interruptions-lead-to-physical-stress.html</a></p> <p><a href=""https&%2358;//linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0306453020302596"">https&%2358;//linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0306453020302596</a></p> <p><a href=""https&%2358;//news.mit.edu/2020/covid-19-cough-cellphone-detection-1029"">https&%2358;//news.mit.edu/2020/covid-19-cough-cellphone-detection-1029</a></p>",human health,human disease,stress,research,,1 - operational work,2 - near to realisation,2 - credible,"<div class=""ExternalClassECEBB7DB9AEC4388A4B894C3056DCF9A"">workforce employment employer employee health wellbeing &quot;mental health&quot; depression stress cortisol office field incident &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; AI &quot;machine learning&quot; protection HEPA filter helmet email office coronavirus Covid-19 exoskeleton voice data privacy &quot;virtual reality&quot; Vocalis Microclimate VR biometric data dementia Parkinsons monitoring</div>",Yes,Yes,No,No,No,,human health,Workforce,Incident management,Data,[],18/05/2022 11:45,"Loveday, Tim",26/05/2021 16:15,"Loveday, Tim",0,,,,,Jason Dinsdale

It is difficult to assess whether these cases actually have a global impact, however it is clear they can affect government policy and regulation on a local level. Studies need to be undertaken to assess if litigation indirectly affects large corporations share prices and subsequently their value. If climate litigation is found to have an impact on a company’s value, it is likely they would take climate related decisions more seriously to protect their profits. A recent example is the settlement of a case brought against an Australian pension fund about their failure to protect retirement savings against climate change risk. This may have implications for pension funds in the future and mean they will need to justify investments in high carbon industries. The current inquiry into the death of a London child whose mother believes illegal levels of air pollution contributed to the death may have further implications. If the coroner rules that air pollution is a cause of death, this would be a first in the UK. This could then have implications for the government, as it is not clear who would be held responsible in this case. As the Environment Agency holds certain regulatory responsibilities for monitoring air pollution it could also mean changes for the way we work.</div>","<div class=""ExternalClassDDEA5AF538464EC78E99E51FE53DDDC9"">https&%2358;//www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Global-trends-in-climate-change-litigation_2020-snapshot.pdf&%23160;</div>",<div>Global trends in climate change litigation&%2358; 2020 snapshot</div>,London School of Economics,01/07/2020,,"<p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.reuters.com/article/us-australia-climatechange-pensions-laws/australian-pension-fund-settles-landmark-climate-lawsuit-idUKKBN27I0DT"">https&%2358;//www.reuters.com/article/us-australia-climatechange-pensions-laws/australian-pension-fund-settles-landmark-climate-lawsuit-idUKKBN27I0DT</a></p> <p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00175-5"">https&%2358;//www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00175-5</a></p> <p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/dec/11/ella-kissi-debrahs-mother-says-she-wants-justice-for-her-daughter"">https&%2358;//www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/dec/11/ella-kissi-debrahs-mother-says-she-wants-justice-for-her-daughter</a></p>",legislation,litigation,regulation,climate,,1 - operational work,1 - realised,2 - credible,"<div class=""ExternalClass824943DBE6D34538B6747685C23D207F"">Finance money regulate law activism &quot;climate change&quot; law pension invest investment company industry carbon &quot;net zero&quot;</div>",Yes,Yes,No,No,No,,legislation,Climate change,regulation,Finance,[],18/05/2022 11:45,"Loveday, Tim",26/05/2021 16:15,"Loveday, Tim",0,,,,,Becky LeAnstey
14992,10/12/2020,Jason Dinsdale,Prospective house buyers may be becoming more cautious about buying properties potentially at risk from the impacts of climate change.,"<div class=""ExternalClass549EE628A6ED43739B291D5D13024A84"">The conclusions of a US based study of the Florida property market may be of interest to the Environment Agency as it comes from an area of more acute flood risk compared to the UK at present. Changes in the property market and land values could have implications for the economics of flood defence construction along with changes to the socioeconomic structure of communities in the most ‘at risk’ areas. A 2019 study of the Florida property market demonstrated that homes exposed to sea level rise (SLR) sell for approximately 7% equivalent unexposed properties despite being the same distance from the beach. This suggests buyers are increasingly sophisticated in their understanding of climate change risks. At the same time, rental rates  were not noticeably impacted. This more recent study which also focuses on Florida found that even though SLR exposed properties were cheaper, their overall prices rose in tandem with less exposed properties between 2013 and 2018. From 2018 however there has been a marked decrease in at risk property prices of 5 per cent. Once differences in finance options have been discounted, the study concludes that the downturn in price is from buyer awareness of sea level rise and climate change impacts. However sellers are not recognising nor responding in the same way, potentially ending a property price bubble. These studies are US based, but may be seen as indicative as a wider recognition of climate change moving up the social, political and economic agenda. As has been seen in Fairbourne Wales (%23******) recognition of SLR’s impact on a community can dramatically impact property prices, but stimulate a rental market, changing the relationship that the community has with its surrounding environment and impacting the dynamics of flood management. <br></div>","<div class=""ExternalClass83EDBE23E9234BC38EB16B8217BF1888"">https&%2358;//www.nber.org/papers/w27930</div>","<div>Neglected no more&%2358; housing markets, mortgage lending, and sea level rise</div>",National Bureau of Economic Research,01/10/2020,,"<p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.researchgate.net/publication/331906928_Sea_Level_Rise_and_House_Price_Capitalisation"">https&%2358;//www.researchgate.net/publication/331906928_Sea_Level_Rise_and_House_Price_Capitalisation</a></p> <p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X19300807"">https&%2358;//www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X19300807</a></p>",climate,flooding,coastal flooding,economics1,,2 - advisory work,2 - near to realisation,1 - Highly credible,"<div class=""ExternalClass6ACF65709ADE467197D8C1C6A354FFE1"">&quot;climate change&quot; &quot;sea level rise&quot; SLR flooding coast property housing economics flood defence flood management price community rent Florida Wales Fairbourne wealth</div>",Yes,Yes,No,No,No,,climate,Climate change,flood management,economics,[],18/05/2022 11:45,"Loveday, Tim",26/05/2021 16:15,"Loveday, Tim",0,,,,,Jason Dinsdale

The US Army has outlines its plans for Robotic Combat Vehicles designed for a range of purposes in the field. Common to many of them is a modular design which soldiers can reconfigure and experiment with in the field, depending on the situation. Many have a degree of autonomy in terms of navigating to the front line. However certain maneuvers, including combat would be overseen by a human controller. Head of the British armed forces, General Nick Carter, recently suggested that ‘robot soldiers’ could form a significant proportion of the armed force working alongside human operatives. While stressing that he wasn’t setting any targets, General Carter suggested a UK fighting force of 120,000 could consist of 30,000 robotic units by the 2030s. The Army has set itself a recruitment target of around 80,000 but has struggled to recruit beyond 73,000. The target may also be reduced by impending spending reviews. Robots could be a potentially cost effective way to make a recruitment shortfall, though this would also require significant investment in research and development. A stretched human force could reduce availability for assistance during major incidents such as flooding where the Army has previously been drafted in. The Environment Agency may need to both consider how it might utilise other avenues of human resources for incident support, but it might also consider how military robotics, particularly if of a modular design, could be repurposed to support incident roles. This may also lead to considering how robotics could contribute to its own vehicle fleet.</div>","<div class=""ExternalClassCDEA81BBB650455AB3B888B3D499C962"">https&%2358;//www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/nov/08/third-world-war-a-risk-in-wake-of-covid-pandemic-says-uk-defence-chief<br>&%23160;</div>",<div>Robot soldiers could make up quarter of British army by 2030s'</div>,The Guardian,08/11/2020,,"<p><a href=""https&%2358;//breakingdefense.com/2020/11/meet-the-armys-future-family-of-robot-tanks-rcv/"">https&%2358;//breakingdefense.com/2020/11/meet-the-armys-future-family-of-robot-tanks-rcv/</a></p>","disasters, accidents, risk",equipment,military equipment,industry1,machinery,1 - operational work,4 - signficant development needed,2 - credible,"<div class=""ExternalClassBC5FE922D9724A6BB1DC54D2D40ED5B9"">automation defence army US military UK &quot;General Nick Carter&quot; robot soldier autonomous AI modular recruitment incident operations field flooding employee employer workforce</div>",Yes,Yes,No,No,No,,"disasters, accidents, risk",Incident management,Workforce,Automation,[],18/05/2022 11:45,"Loveday, Tim",26/05/2021 16:15,"Loveday, Tim",0,,,,,Jason Dinsdale

The project was set up to help facilitate the inclusion of more climate conscious contracts, by creating text that could be used by those who don’t have time to develop their own. It has already been downloaded over 15,000 times in 76 countries. The recognition that law firms can play a role in enabling climate friendly policies has also been seen in reverse as activists target big law firms that work for the fossil fuel industry. The climate groups are targeting these large law firms who work on behalf of fossil fuel industries, but are usually not the focus of attention. Climate activism and targeting of fossil fuel industries has led to a smaller pool of graduates willing to work in the fossil fuel sector. It is possible that some of the bigger law firms may not wish to work with fossil fuel companies if they fear they may suffer the same fate. The Environment Agency is already engaged with the Chancery Lane Project, but it will be of interest to see how the inclusion of such legal text may influence our partners and industry in the future.</div>","<div class=""ExternalClassC46DF681E1C74B51A49BDDBC9FF97FE8"">https&%2358;//www.iflr.com/article/b1mj5yxhbd6fl0/uk-lawyers-work-together-to-tackle-climate-change&%23160;</div>",<div>UK Lawyers work together to tackle climate change</div>,IFLR,20/07/2020,,"<p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.businessinsider.com/big-law-firms-climate-change-activists-strategy-pressure-politics-2020-10?r=US&amp;IR=T"">https&%2358;//www.businessinsider.com/big-law-firms-climate-change-activists-strategy-pressure-politics-2020-10?r=US&amp;IR=T</a></p>",legislation,administrative law,,climate,,1 - operational work,1 - realised,2 - credible,"<div class=""ExternalClass4EF6E147B08843A2A7C677C40E989694"">&quot;climate change&quot; activism policy regulation law legal contract recruitment</div>",No,Yes,No,No,No,,legislation,Climate change,0,0,[],18/05/2022 11:45,"Loveday, Tim",26/05/2021 16:15,"Loveday, Tim",0,,,,,Becky LeAnstey

The report implies current models of the technologies are too linear and do not show how quickly product development and business change could alter the market. They argue that a more holistic approach is needed by taking a systems approach to energy focusing on market forces. The report highlights the risk of investing in coal, gas and nuclear as these systems will soon be much more expensive than SWB and therefore investments may become stranded. This is at odds with the governments recently published 10 point covid recovery plan which supports the development of small modular reactors. Should SWB become a large part of the future energy mix it will likely cause disruption to existing systems and will require new infrastructure requiring different policy and regulatory frameworks.

14988,08/12/2020,Becky LeAnstey,Government and business interest in developing a hydrogen economy is gaining traction.,"<div class=""ExternalClassC53DFA5C46BD454CBC9F31D7082CC49E"">Hydrogen has been hailed as a potential energy supply medium of the future for a number of years, due to its abundance, versatility and the fact it can be used without emitting any greenhouse gasses. The difficulty however lies in the energy needed to produce the hydrogen in the first place, which can result in the use of fossil fuels and thus has associated emissions. Blue hydrogen is produced using natural gas or gasification of coal with carbon capture and storage (CCS). Green hydrogen can be generated using energy from renewables such as wind or solar, but is currently more expensive. Economics and the cost of producing hydrogen and converting infrastructure mean that it is not currently cost effective without market interventions. Both the EU and the UK have produced covid recovery plans that aim to drive the development of low carbon hydrogen in the future. Businesses such as Siemens are trialling technology such as hydrogen fuel cells in off grid locations and have also made a commitment to explore the development of hydrogen powered trains. The Humber Zero project is a collaboration between multiple organisations to look at the feasibility of developing an industrial hub powered by hydrogen. All these signals of change together suggest a growing momentum of support for hydrogen to play a part in the future energy mix as we move to a lower carbon world. This has huge implications for how the Environment Agency may need to regulate in the future. Industry based on hydrogen at least in the beginning would likely be more location dependant, and therefore certain areas may need more resource to support this growing industry.</div>","<div class=""ExternalClass5BC9B0DCAA3E4AA2ABDD0D95C77B3F53"">https&%2358;//about.bnef.com/blog/liebreich-separating-hype-from-hydrogen-part-one-the-supply-side/</div>",<div>Separating Hype from Hydrogen – Part One&%2358; The Supply Side</div>,Bloomberg,08/10/2020,,"<p><a href=""https&%2358;//about.bnef.com/blog/liebreich-separating-hype-from-hydrogen-part-two-the-demand-side/"">https&%2358;//about.bnef.com/blog/liebreich-separating-hype-from-hydrogen-part-two-the-demand-side/</a></p> <p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.cnbc.com/2020/10/06/siemens-energy-and-mobility-sign-joint-agreement-on-hydrogen-trains.html"">https&%2358;//www.cnbc.com/2020/10/06/siemens-energy-and-mobility-sign-joint-agreement-on-hydrogen-trains.html</a></p> <p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.cnbc.com/2020/09/03/construction-site-uses-hydrogen-fuel-cell-tech-to-power-operations.html"">https&%2358;//www.cnbc.com/2020/09/03/construction-site-uses-hydrogen-fuel-cell-tech-to-power-operations.html</a></p> <p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.humberzero.co.uk/"">https&%2358;//www.humberzero.co.uk/</a></p> <p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-ten-point-plan-for-a-green-industrial-revolution"">https&%2358;//www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-ten-point-plan-for-a-green-industrial-revolution</a></p>",energy,alternative fuel,regulation,climate,,1 - operational work,3 - some development needed,2 - credible,"<div class=""ExternalClass094826D20A57405DBA419D1ADC477693"">Hydrogen energy waste &quot;fossil fuel&quot; emit emission pollution &quot;climate change&quot; industry fuel CCS carbon gas resource</div>",Yes,Yes,No,No,No,,energy,Climate change,regulation,Industry,[],18/05/2022 11:45,"Loveday, Tim",26/05/2021 16:15,"Loveday, Tim",0,,,,,Becky LeAnstey
14987,04/12/2020,Liisa Tang,UK’s first vegan butcher opens but copies the looks and product names of a traditional meat butcher’s.,"<div class=""ExternalClass7C15E434CB2348E098AA09B1327B9B74"">The first vegan butcher’s shop opening is not astounding news in itself as it simply demonstrates the vegan consumer trend, but what is significant is that the looks and language the entrepreneur has decided to use resemble traditional butcher’s shop and meat-based looks and language rather than attempting to align to vegan values by creating new names and products. This is of interest to Defra as it reveals that plant-based diets are not established sufficiently on their own yet as they seem to require “meat” concepts to validate their existence, and as long as the language used in the society is meat-free &quot;meats&quot; and dairy-free cheeses, the change is not substantial.<br>One of the arguments towards this behaviour has been that many are inspired to try a plant-based alternative vegan diet when the “fake meat” or “meat-free meat” product names, shapes and looks are similar to meat products, and tasting them makes consumers realise that there are tasty alternatives to meat. The products made from soya and seitan are designed to resemble the taste and texture of meat.<br>There is also research conducted in the consumer and purchasing behaviour of vegans and vegetarians regarding meat-based names, indicating that it attracts many vegetarians but deters vegans from purchasing. Examples of plant-based consumer language is vegan “butcher’s” or “carcass wholesalers” for the store; and for products “lobstah salad”, “rack of jack”, chilli-non carne, “chick’n lover plate”, “shredded BBQ pulled porc”, and for the Christmas season “roast turk’y” or “tofurky.”</div>","<div class=""ExternalClass9AAE3CAA445044509BFE9F52FACA5497"">https&%2358;//www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8906083/UKs-vegan-butcher-sells-day.html&%23160;</div>",<div>Bringing home the fake-on!

14980,25/11/2020,Jason Dinsdale,The emergence of the ‘honjok’ lifestyle in South Korea gives an idea of what a society of increasing numbers of single people could look like.,"<div class=""ExternalClass094C7795496148DB9E1E077E17E7489D"">The emergence of the ‘honjok’ lifestyle in South Korea gives an idea of what a society of increasing numbers of single people could look like. Around the World marriage is on the decline and more people are remaining single late into life. For example, it has been estimated that by the time today’s young adults in the USA reach 50, one in four will have never been married. Outside of the USA the four countries with the highest rates of solo living are Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Denmark, where up to 45 per cent of all households contain just one person. The single lifestyle is known as “honjok” in South Korea which translates as “alone tribe”. The equivalent in Japan is the “ohitorisama” movement, meaning “party of one”, or “hitori”, “one person”. Both societies are traditionally collectivist, with little culture of doing things alone. In South Korea honjok has arisen as a push back against rigid social and cultural demands to study, find a job and start a family. While it is difficult to define what constitutes honjok, those identifying with tend to be single, live and partake is social activities alone. Some identify more with the ‘tribe’ aspect of single life, but interactions tend to take place online. Many honjok are women, rejecting marriage, child-rearing and even relationships. As living alone has risen in prominence the market has responded to what is a lucrative market&%2358; bars, sports clubs, food delivery, restaurants and even karaoke bars now cater for single people. The rise of mobile internet is seen as either a trigger or a facilitator for a societal change that was already brewing. Technology use has been cited as both a cause of and a solution to growing social seclusion in that it allows people to connect but at the same time there is a correlated risk between isolation and mental health issues. What is apparent however is shifts in economic models that were already in play but that have been accelerated by the coronavirus pandemic are conducive to the honjok lifestyle. These include the rise of “untact” contactless interactions such as ordering food, taxis and sending gifts without the need for human interaction.  Other emerging technologies which receive government interest such as  remote work systems, high-speed internet and 5G, and self-driving cars, drones, robots, and other AI initiatives further remove the need for human interaction. Indeed examples of untact technologies can be found in the countries already mentioned, including robot couriers in Helsinki, remotely controlled shelf stacking robots in Tokyo, and unstaffed digital supermarkets in rural Sweden. Novel social practices such as ‘social distancing’ may become normalised in a post Covid-19 world, further driving isolation. What is happening in South Korea and Japan could spread elsewhere. It is estimated that there will be a 128 per cent growth in single-person households worldwide between 2000 and 2030. A future “super solo society”, may be characterised by young people who never marry and elderly who become single again after being widowed. This has social, political and demographic implications but also environmental ones. More individual households could increase consumption patterns of energy, water, goods and waste. Land use and planning decisions around construction being made today may not be fit for increasing single occupancy households. In this context the single lifestyle may factor directly or indirectly into the Environment Agency’s future remit.</div>","<div class=""ExternalClass8C2A999220FF4A9DBA0B2DD9F1D2F07D"">https&%2358;//restofworld.org/2020/south-korea-honjok-loneliness/</div>","<div>Tune in, drop out</div>",Rest Of World,14/07/2020,"Babe, A","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/living-single/201908/around-the-world-marriage-is-declining-singles-are-rising"">https&%2358;//www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/living-single/201908/around-the-world-marriage-is-declining-singles-are-rising</a></p> <p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.unmarried.org/featured/how-south-korea-is-accommodating-not-shaming-singles-who-live-alone/"">https&%2358;//www.unmarried.org/featured/how-south-korea-is-accommodating-not-shaming-singles-who-live-alone/</a></p> <p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200113-the-rise-of-japans-super-solo-culture"">https&%2358;//www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200113-the-rise-of-japans-super-solo-culture</a></p> <p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.brainpickings.org/2012/05/09/going-solo-klinenberg/"">https&%2358;//www.brainpickings.org/2012/05/09/going-solo-klinenberg/</a></p> <p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/06/unstaffed-digital-supermarkets-transform-rural-sweden"">https&%2358;//www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/06/unstaffed-digital-supermarkets-transform-rural-sweden</a></p> <p><a href=""https&%2358;//edition.cnn.com/2020/09/14/business/robots-japan-supermarkets-spc-intl/index.html"">https&%2358;//edition.cnn.com/2020/09/14/business/robots-japan-supermarkets-spc-intl/index.html</a></p> <p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.electronicspecifier.com/industries/robotics/robot-courier-delivering-food-from-shop-to-home"">https&%2358;//www.electronicspecifier.com/industries/robotics/robot-courier-delivering-food-from-shop-to-home</a></p>","social aspects, population",social behaviour,Planning,"social aspects, population",,2 - advisory work,4 - signficant development needed,3 - less credible,"<div class=""ExternalClass4586DDBF1CDC43E684AA6046F343C1D1"">population demographics lifestyle regulation single household honjok “alone tribe”  &quot;South Korea&quot; Sweden Norway  Helsinki Tokyo remote control supermarket rural Finland Denmark USA Japan ohitorisama “party of one” “one person”hitori marriage contactless death widow 5G &quot;self-driving&quot; &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; AI drone robot untact &quot;remote working&quot; workforce employee housing planning energy water resources waste consumption isolation mental health depression birth child-rearing women economy entertainment restaurant bar sport government technology online internet smartphone</div>",Yes,Yes,No,No,No,,"social aspects, population",Population and demographics,Planning,Resources,[],18/05/2022 11:45,"Loveday, Tim",26/05/2021 16:15,"Loveday, Tim",0,,,,,Jason Dinsdale

Researchers have experimented with viruses in laboratory conditions to simulate warmer lake water. Some of the viruses developed resistance to warmer water and certain disinfectants including chlorine, both in the presence and absence of sunlight. This could suggest that viruses may become increasingly hard to kill in a warming climate using standard water treatment technologies and may also present an increased risk to human health in bathing waters. Increasing global travel and trade could exacerbate the issue as contaminated products are moved about more readily into regions with increasingly warmer, more favourable climates. Elsewhere newly discovered marine organisms have been discovered that appear to eat viruses for nutrition. Simple two celled organisms called protists from the coastal waters of Maine, USA were examined, only to find that their stomach contents contained traces of virus DNA, but not bacteria DNA. This suggests that they feeding exclusively on viruses, which are rich in phosphorus and nitrogen. It is possible to envisage protist affinity for viruses playing a role in water treatment where virus content of water becomes problematic.</div>","<div class=""ExternalClass4422D0D4DE5D4545889AB87C6EDBA13B"">https&%2358;//actu.epfl.ch/news/viruses-could-become-harder-to-kill-2/</div>",<div>Viruses could become harder to kill</div>,EPFL,23/09/2020,,"<p><a href=""https&%2358;//pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.est.0c03199"">https&%2358;//pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.est.0c03199</a></p> <p><a href=""https&%2358;//interestingengineering.com/newly-discovered-organisms-actually-eat-viruses-finally"">https&%2358;//interestingengineering.com/newly-discovered-organisms-actually-eat-viruses-finally</a></p> <p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2020.524828/full"">https&%2358;//www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2020.524828/full</a></p>",water1,waste water treatment,Climate Change,human health,,2 - advisory work,3 - some development needed,1 - Highly credible,"<div class=""ExternalClass93AF7079A53E4A8580B4224E993AD350"">virus &quot;climate change&quot; water pollution &quot;water quality&quot; bathing waters &quot;water treatment&quot; marine protist trade transport disinfectant chlorine regulation health</div>",Yes,Yes,No,No,No,,water,Water quality,Climate Change,Health,[],18/05/2022 11:45,"Loveday, Tim",26/05/2021 16:15,"Loveday, Tim",0,,,,,Jason Dinsdale

14977,23/11/2020,Jason Dinsdale,The Welsh government recently stated an ambition for 30 per cent of Wales’s workforce to be working remotely in the future.,"<div class=""ExternalClassA95EA0EBED8444CA9B4D9750D6446E22"">Changes in the devolved administrations such as this could lead to other countries adopting similar targets, which could in turn impact on the Environment Agency’s workforce and workplace arrangements. Covid-19 has seen a huge increase in the numbers of people working from home, bringing with it reductions in congestion, pollution and private car use. The Welsh Government wishes to see these environmental improvements continue beyond the coronavirus pandemic through developing a working culture that helps productivity as well as their work-life balance. In support of this they are exploring the idea of community-based remote working hubs to offer choices beyond a simple home/office split. These hubs would be within walking and cycling distance of people’s homes and could be used by public, private and third-sector employees. They could also help encourage new partnerships between government, industry, and others. Recent analysis by the Office of National Statistics (ONS) has revealed that the ability to work remotely is closely linked to pay, with people in higher paying jobs more likely to be able to work from home. The median earnings of employees in the 20 per cent  of the workforce most likely to be able to work from home is £19.01, compared with £11.28 for workers in the 20 per cent of workers in jobs least likely to be adaptable to home working. The majority of employees not able to work remotely are men - 78 per cent despite making up 48 per cent of the workforce. Jobs based in workplaces in London and the South East are much more likely to be possible to do from home compared with the rest of the UK, probably due to a higher proportion of professional occupations in the region. The current data could therefore suggest achieving a greater proportion of remote working could require marked structural changes to the economy and the infrastructure that supports it (assuming that employment levels remain at a constant level), applying to all areas of the UK. <br></div>","<div class=""ExternalClass18F549849F264A0B85D18D59C328FC11"">https&%2358;//gov.wales/aim-30-welsh-workforce-work-remotely</div>",<div>Aim for 30% of the Welsh workforce to work remotely</div>,Welsh Government,13/09/2020,,"<p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/articles/whichjobscanbedonefromhome/2020-07-21"">https&%2358;//www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/articles/whichjobscanbedonefromhome/2020-07-21</a></p>","trade, services",central government,Urban,"trade, services",,1 - operational work,5 - conceptual,2 - credible,"<div class=""ExternalClass11327B0BF7A2490D966E75984F2B3578"">workforce employment employer employee remote home Wales hub pollution congestion vehicle car health wellbeing &quot;work-life balance&quot; salary pay unemployment London &quot;South East&quot; men demographics population</div>",Yes,Yes,No,No,No,,"trade, services",Workforce,Urban,Health,[],18/05/2022 11:45,"Loveday, Tim",26/05/2021 16:15,"Loveday, Tim",0,,,,,Jason Dinsdale

The new experiments however imply that despite having different brain structures to humans and great apes they are capable of subjective experiences. The brain activity of two crows was monitored as they were shown a figure on a screen of varying brightness, which they reported by activating coloured lights.

The World Bank suggests demand for materials such as lithium, cobalt, zinc, copper and many other metals and minerals could see an increase in demand of 500% by 2050. Mining these resources can have a negative impact on the environment, with many local communities already protesting as they fear they will destroy local heritage sites. Communities in Portugal are already protesting about the exploration of sites for Lithium mining, with some licences revoked after local opposition. A group of researchers have mapped known mining areas around the world and have found that 82% of all mines are targeting minerals or metals that are required for renewables technologies. 8% of sites were linked to protected areas, 7% with key biodiversity areas, and 16% with wilderness sties. As demand increases, this competition for land is only set to increase. This is a global problem that requires strategic oversight and planning to ensure mining for metals, minerals and other resources for renewables technologies are done in the most sustainable way.

Not all forestry is equal, with the report suggesting that current commercial tree plantations do not sequester carbon as more than half of that harvested is used in products with such a short shelf life that the emissions are returned to the atmosphere. Furthermore of the 2018 timber harvest in the UK, 23% was burnt directly as fuel. Afforestation needs careful planning in order to prevent insensitive planting on peat bogs that have a negative impact on both carbon sequestration and biodiversity. The report suggests slower growing diverse broadleaved plantations are better for both biodiversity and long term carbon sequestration. This needs to be balanced against the need for timber, if we cannot match demand in the UK, the carbon footprint would just be exported overseas.

In order to take advantage of this approach and technology of delivering sensors to create a “sensory network” running over a relatively long time, the main technological features must be fine-tuned according to the location. <br>First of all, the sensor must be lightweight – the researchers used sensor systems weighing 98 milligrams – for the drone or moth to carry effortlessly. When in the right location, a command is sent via Bluetooth so the sensor is released. The heaviest part, the battery, is located in the corner of the sensor system and this makes it spin and then land safely from as high as 22 metres without damage to the system from the freefall. Current batteries can transmit data up to one kilometre and the batteries last two and half years, but researchers are looking to replace them with solar cells in future.<br>Drones and live moths have their own advantages&%2358; working with the drones is more measured as they can be controlled directly but they are limited by battery lives. The benefit of using moths is that they can fly for hours and fit into smaller spaces if required.<br>Limitations that need to be considered for the sensor systems are their contact with the environment where they fall; withstanding weathering, staying in the original location, not impacting nature in the location in any negative way, including the need to pick them all up after the batteries are finished. This type of miniscule sensor network also raises ethical questions about monitoring and surveillance.<br></div>","<div class=""ExternalClass2CF0FC55128F4ACC875A1FB8CEE29068"">https&%2358;//sensordrop.cs.washington.edu/&%23160;</div>",<div>Tiny sensor system can be airdropped by drones and insects where needed</div>,University of Washington,08/10/2020,"Iyer, V., Kim,M., Xue, S., Wang,A., Gollakota, S.","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//newatlas.com/electronics/tiny-sensors-airdropped-drones-insects/"">https&%2358;//newatlas.com/electronics/tiny-sensors-airdropped-drones-insects/</a></p> <p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.washington.edu/news/2020/10/08/airdropping-sensors-from-moths/"">https&%2358;//www.washington.edu/news/2020/10/08/airdropping-sensors-from-moths/</a></p> <p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.washington.edu/news/2020/07/15/robotic-camera-backpack-for-insects/%c2%a0"">https&%2358;//www.washington.edu/news/2020/07/15/robotic-camera-backpack-for-insects/&%23160;</a></p> <p><a href=""https&%2358;//spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/robotics-hardware/cyborg-beetles-for-swarming-search-and-rescue%c2%a0"">https&%2358;//spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/robotics-hardware/cyborg-beetles-for-swarming-search-and-rescue&%23160;</a></p> <p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/10/fireball-dropping-drones-new-technology-helping-fight-fires/"">https&%2358;//www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/10/fireball-dropping-drones-new-technology-helping-fight-fires/</a></p>",climate,pollutant monitoring,pollutant source identification,environmental policy1,sensor,1 - operational work,2 - near to realisation,2 - credible,"<div class=""ExternalClass322318B4B00A4C55ABDD8411147B10AC"">drones moths bumblebees insects sensors &quot;sensor system&quot; &quot;sensor networks&quot; technology design engineering electronics monitoring surveillance robotics robot fires airdropping &quot;wireless sensors&quot;</div>",No,Yes,No,No,No,,climate,Climate change,0,0,[],18/05/2022 11:45,"Loveday, Tim",26/05/2021 16:15,"Loveday, Tim",0,,,,,Liisa Tang

HAPSMobile, a Japanese company recently test flew a giant solar powered drone that beamed internet access from the stratosphere. The 80 metre wingspan Sunglider drone hosted video calls from 19 kilometres above New Mexico during a 20 hour test flight. Providing internet access in this way has parallels with other projects to use both balloons (%23*****) and satellites (%23*****), negating the need for conventional telecommunications infrastructure such as mobile phone masts. Google is experimenting with a wireless high speed internet network using light. Project Taara is being trialled in Kenya. The network functions on the same principle as fibre optic cable, but without the cabling, transferring high speed internet between terminals up to 12 miles. The system could have applications in providing high speed connectivity where its challenging, dangerous or too costly to lay fibre cables, such as over rivers, rural areas, or in post-conflict and disaster-stricken spots. &%23160;In another recent development a cryptocurrency startup used satellite technology to facilitate transactions of virtual currency BitCoin without access to the internet. The experiment took place in Venezuela, a country with limited and intermittent access to both the internet and electricity. The startup created a “space node” that uses an established system which uses satellites to broadcast data between points called BlockStream. The node on the ground sends and receives BitCoin transaction data directly via satellite. Using local mesh networks it would be possible to connect devices and exchange data, increasing usability of BitCoin in a country with low technological infrastructure, bypassing the internet and demonstrating the open and borderless character of BitCoin and blockchain systems.</div>","<div class=""ExternalClass2E77F3D5B4A5423F9805F4BFEF467460"">https&%2358;//www.techtelegraph.co.uk/no-internet-no-problem-venezuela-gets-bitcoin-satellite-node/</div>","<div>No internet, no problem.

14968,10/11/2020,Jason Dinsdale,"Developments in transparent materials, silicon recycling and heat absorbing liquids suggest that architecture, specifically windows, may become an increasing important aspect of solar energy generation.","<div class=""ExternalClassF686825363484F8A946CBDCE5A4B31BC"">These developments should be of interest to the Environment Agency from the perspective of contributing to net zero through asset management. It should also be of interest from a waste management perspective and also from a land management angle. Specially tinted solar panels could allow for photovoltaics and farming to take place on the same land. The orange coloured solar panels absorb specific wavelengths of light for energy generation, but still allow the  wavelengths needed for plant growth to pass through. A similar system could allow farmers to profit from crops and energy simultaneously and even grow food with superior nutritional value through optimised light wavelengths. Researchers have reached a new efficiency record for transparent solar cells, designed to sit between panels of window glass. The solar panel is made of an organic, or carbon-based, design rather than conventional silicon. UbiQD, an advanced materials company, has developed transparent solar panels based around quantum dots. Quantum dots are nanoparticles that become excited from exposure to UV light. They release photons that travel along the transparent panel towards its edge. The perimeter is fitted with solar cells, which convert the photons into electrical current. The solar cell edging sits in the frame of a window, out of sight. As these technologies come to the fore, innovations in conventional silicon solar panel recycling are emerging. Researchershave demonstrated a simple efficient method to recycling silicon wafers into nanoparticles in an aqueous solution without using toxic chemicals. The process can control the sizes of the nanoparticles which can then be reused in optics, photonics, medicine, and other fields. The system proved successful with HR (High resistivity), N-type (Nitrogen-doped), and P-type (Phosphorus-doped) and Si-ITO heterostructure solar panels. While not energy generating, a team of Singapore scientists have developed a “smart window” that uses a liquid solution trapped between two glass panels to trap thermal heat during the day and release it at night, potentially cutting down on the need for air conditioning systems. The liquid consists of micro-hydrogel, water, and a stabilising compound. <br>As well as trapping heat the liquid becomes opaque as it warms, further helping to block out the light and keep the room cool. It returns to its transparent state as it cools. The team believes their system could reduce office energy demands by 45 per cent, but it remains to be seen whether  potential consumers would be willing to trade lower visibility for greater energy efficiency.  Researchers have developed a transparent material made of wood  that can potentially outperform glass in terms of durability, weight and safety (splintering rather than shattering). Transparent wood is made by oxidising and treating balsa wood at room temperature with  oxidisation and bleaching. The wood is then penetrated with a synthetic polymer called polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), creating a product that is virtually transparent.Glass comes with a large carbon footprint. Transparent wood is five times more thermally efficient than glass, cutting energy costs. It is from a sustainable materials with low carbon emissions. It’s also compatible with existing industrial processing equipment, promising an easy manufacturing transition.<br></div>","<div class=""ExternalClass298617D78E0B4F9586B47427837B47CC"">https&%2358;//interestingengineering.com/tinted-solar-panel-farms-can-grow-food-while-generating-electricity</div>",<div>Tinted solar panel farms can grow food while generating electricity</div>,Interesting Engineering,07/09/2020,"Young, C","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//institutions.newscientist.com/article/2253816-windows-become-transparent-solar-panels-with-added-nanoparticles/"">https&%2358;//institutions.newscientist.com/article/2253816-windows-become-transparent-solar-panels-with-added-nanoparticles/</a></p> <p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.designboom.com/technology/transparent-solar-panels-quantum-dots-energy-ubiqd-07-09-2020/"">https&%2358;//www.designboom.com/technology/transparent-solar-panels-quantum-dots-energy-ubiqd-07-09-2020/</a></p> <p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.scoop.co.nz/stories/SC2009/S00008/environmentally-friendly-way-to-recycle-silicon-into-nanoparticles.htm"">https&%2358;//www.scoop.co.nz/stories/SC2009/S00008/environmentally-friendly-way-to-recycle-silicon-into-nanoparticles.htm</a></p> <p><a href=""https&%2358;//interestingengineering.com/ntu-singapore-scientists-develop-energy-saving-liquid-window"">https&%2358;//interestingengineering.com/ntu-singapore-scientists-develop-energy-saving-liquid-window</a></p> <p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.usda.gov/media/blog/2020/10/01/transparent-wood-could-be-window-future"">https&%2358;//www.usda.gov/media/blog/2020/10/01/transparent-wood-could-be-window-future</a></p>",energy,Energy,Waste,agriculture,,1 - operational work,4 - signficant development needed,2 - credible,"<div class=""ExternalClassCC12FFE5AE804AE79275874D4CEF04A7"">waste energy &quot;climate change&quot; silicon solar photovoltaic glass window &quot;quantum dot&quot; recycling transparent farming field crop regulation land use UbiQD UV light  wavelength organic photon semiconductor radiation cosmic ray nanoparticle optics photonics medicine chemical toxic regulation pollution HR &quot;High resistivity&quot; N-type &quot;Nitrogen-doped&quot; P-type Phosphorus-doped Si-ITO heterostructure micro-hydrogel effciency office air conditioning plant photosynthesis food aqueous wood balsa oxidisation bleach &quot;polyvinyl alcohol&quot; PVA polymer carbon &quot;climate change&quot; thermal regulation industry</div>",Yes,Yes,No,No,No,,energy,Energy,Waste,Climate change,[],18/05/2022 11:45,"Loveday, Tim",26/05/2021 16:15,"Loveday, Tim",0,,,,,Jason Dinsdale
14967,09/11/2020,Jason Dinsdale,"Just as recent advances move the World closer to a quantum computing future, it’s been discovered that natural cosmic rays could hold development back.","<div class=""ExternalClassFD19C01BC09C4A51B17301D8D44E080D"">Among the many applications and transformations that quantum computing promises the Environment Agency may be interested most in those around modelling of environmental phenomena, including catchment behaviours and chemical reactions. In this vein Google recently announced that they had successfully modelled the first quantum simulation of a chemical reaction. Google used its Sycamore computer to perform the simulation. In previous experiments Sycamore completed a calculation in 200 seconds that would take a state-of-the-art supercomputer 10,000 years to finish. Sycamore simulated a diazene molecule undergoing a process where the hydrogen atoms rearranged themselves around the nitrogen ones.The same process was modelled on normal computer for comparison. Google believes that they will be able to scale up the algorithm for more complex chemical reactions with greater numbers of qubits (the quantum version of the classical binary bit physically realized with a two-state device). A Toronto based start up called Xanadu suggests a way to address this by putting access to quantum computing available through the cloud. Xanadu’s computer is based on photonic quantum computing which is more stable than other technologies and can more easily integrate into telecommunication systems, potentially paving the way for connecting quantum computers together into powerful networks, known as  “time multiplexing” architectures. Amongst the many technical issues for quantum developers to overcome is the discovery that background environmental radiation is of a sufficient level to disrupt quantum computing systems based on superconducting materials that produce qubits via charged pairs of electrons. This could limit the locations in which such computers could be used as they may need to be shielded e.g. through underground locations or material such as lead. While this discovery may present technological, geographical and economic barriers to realisation, it also suggests that  qubits could present  a new avenue to pursue in developing radiation monitoring technologies.</div>","<div class=""ExternalClassF0320715ED5642DB82C5059541987BD8"">https&%2358;//interestingengineering.com/google-achieves-first-quantum-simulation-of-a-chemical-reaction</div><div class=""ExternalClassF0320715ED5642DB82C5059541987BD8"">&%23160;</div>",<div>Google achieves first quantum simulation of a chemical reaction</div>,Interesting Engineering,28/08/2020,"Papadopoulos, L","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//institutions.newscientist.com/article/2253089-google-performed-the-first-quantum-simulation-of-a-chemical-reaction/"">https&%2358;//institutions.newscientist.com/article/2253089-google-performed-the-first-quantum-simulation-of-a-chemical-reaction/</a></p> <p><a href=""https&%2358;//spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/computing/hardware/photonic-quantum"">https&%2358;//spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/computing/hardware/photonic-quantum</a></p> <p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.technologyreview.com/2020/08/26/1007688/cosmic-rays-could-pose-a-problem-for-future-quantum-computers/"">https&%2358;//www.technologyreview.com/2020/08/26/1007688/cosmic-rays-could-pose-a-problem-for-future-quantum-computers/</a></p>",information,Regulation,Modelling,space,,1 - operational work,4 - signficant development needed,2 - credible,"<div class=""ExternalClassA29A82C4D129464FB2870FA808177B25"">quantum computing computer qubit Google Sycamore chemical reaction chemistry pollution hydrogen diazene molecule Xanadu Toronto Canada “time multiplexing” photon network telecommunications radiation monitoring superconducting superconductor concrete lead underground regulation</div>",Yes,Yes,No,No,No,,information,Regulation,Modelling,Pollution,[],18/05/2022 11:45,"Loveday, Tim",26/05/2021 16:15,"Loveday, Tim",0,,,,,Jason Dinsdale

Nasa has outlined plans to return astronauts by 2024 as part of its Artemis programme, including the first female astronaut to visit the Moon. The plan also calls for the establishment of a base known as Artemis Base Camp to create the infrastructure needed for long term exploration. Deposits of water ice have been discovered at the lunar South Pole, which could support humans or make rocket fuel at a lower cost than transporting it from Earth and serve as the foundation for a lunar economy. Nasa has already funded a project to develop drilling equipment and a mass spectrometer to measure how much ice in the sample is lost as the ice turns from a solid to a vapour in the vacuum of the lunar environment. Nasa have approached telecommunications company Nokia to build a 4G network to support communications on the lunar surface. Uses will include command and control functions, the remote control of lunar rovers, real-time navigation, and high-definition video streaming. With this comes ambiguity over how individuals, nations and corporations can use lunar resources. President Donald Trump has signed an executive order on off-Earth resources which suggest that celestial resources including the Moon are framed in commercial terms. The Moon is known to be a source of helium, which is becoming increasingly rare on Earth (%23*****). There is also the potential for rare earth element extraction. Some are proposing that the Moon should be granted legal personhood in order to give it legal protection from overexploitation and environmental damage. Similar protections have already been granted to rivers including the Ganges (%23*****). Areas such as the Sea of Tranquility where Neil Armstrong first set foot on the Moon could be granted special protection. The Moon has both a physical (tides) and spiritual agency on the Earth, being a part of cultural myths and religious beliefs. Granting the Moon personhood In practice could mean regulated activities on resource extraction and other activities and limits on how its geological features can be used, ensuring that our presence on the Moon reflects changing attitudes to environmental exploitation on Earth. In this sense experience of best practice in environmental regulation could become valued, particularly as the Environment Agency is considered ‘a world class regulator.</div>","<div class=""ExternalClassAEB28F38BD144F9697CDFE2EA8B1946F"">https&%2358;//theconversation.com/can-the-moon-be-a-person-as-lunar-mining-looms-a-change-of-perspective-could-protect-earths-ancient-companion-144848<br>&%23160;</div>","<div>Can the Moon be a person?

The Graphene Flagship Standardization Committee (GFSC) has recently launched a Standardization Certificate, which recognises the efforts and expertise of those developing international standards or technical specifications in graphene and related materials. The aim of the award is to standardise commercial graphene. The global graphene market was valued at $35 million in 2018, and could reach $406 million by 2026. Standardisation may therefore become increasingly important in realisation. There’s already an issue with ‘fake graphene’ which doesn’t have the properties of ‘true’ graphene. The lack of consistency and fraud is thought to essentially be holding back both research and industry. Establishing standards may catalyse innovation, increase efficiency and reduce costs and lower barriers to market entry.

Placing data centres underwater avoids the costs of cooling servers and greater energy efficiency. Over half the world’s population lives close to coastal areas, potentially creating smoother web access through having data centres nearby. Data creation and storage is also increasing at a significant rate. Microsoft have attempted to address this through the creation of a data storage medium made of quartz glass. They’ve experimented with DNA data storage, as have others (%23*****), but found glass storage to be more practical. Just like DVDs are burnt and read, infrared layers are used to distort the glass, which can be read by lasers and decoded back into data. Microsoft was able to put 75.6TB of data onto fused silica, which is a 2.5-inch hard disk drive. By comparison the largest hard disk drives in the world currently have a 20TB data storage capacity on a 3.5-inch hard disk drive. Quartz is one of the most ubiquitous minerals on Earth, meaning that glass storage devices may be less tied to access to rare minerals and metals.

14963,22/10/2020,Jason Dinsdale,A New Zealand startup is trialling a commercial long range wireless power transmission.,"<div class=""ExternalClassC39B906B778B43DDBC3FAAA2F10C1314"">This development should be of interest to the Environment Agency and partners as it has the potential to alter approaches to infrastructure provision and the environmental impacts it generates. The company called Emrod has developed a method to safely transmit electricity without the use of copper wire between two points within line of sight of each other. They are currently trialling the system with a power generation company, Powerco. The prototype can currently transmit only a few kilowatts of power, but it’s thought that this could easily be scaled up to transmit 100 times the power over longer distances at around 70 per cent efficiency.The system uses a transmitting antenna, a series of relays and a receiving rectenna capable of converting microwave energy into electricity. The beams use the non-ionizing Industrial, Scientific and Medical band of the radio spectrum, including frequencies commonly used in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. A &quot;low power laser safety curtain&quot; immediately shuts down power transmission before any object, like a bird, drone, power thief or helicopter, can touch the main beam. Atmospheric conditions don’t impede efficiency,  and the only limiting factor being line of sight to transmitting power at a fraction of the infrastructure costs, maintenance costs and environmental impacts of conventional wired solutions. The technology is not particularly new - Nikolai Tesla envisaged such as system and power has been transmitted from space to Earth using similar principles (%23*****). It is mainly the advances in metamaterials technology that allow microwave energy to be converted back into electricity efficiently.Powerco envisage using Emrod’s technology to deliver electricity in remote places, or across challenging terrain, or continue power supply during maintenance activities. It could also be used to transmit power from remote renewable energy plants to markets. This could also see temporary deployment to address shortfalls in conventional infrastructure compromised by incidents.</div>","<div class=""ExternalClass46421559FE6340FC8665B319404CB5DE"">https&%2358;//newatlas.com/energy/long-range-wireless-power-transmission-new-zealand-emrod/<br>&%23160;</div>","<div>NZ to trial world-first commercial long-range, wireless power transmission</div>",New Atlas (NEW TECHNOLOGY & SCIENCE NEWS),03/08/2020,"Blain, L","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//newatlas.com/energy/wireless-power-transmission-emrod-interview/?itm_source=newatlas&amp;itm_medium=article-body"">https&%2358;//newatlas.com/energy/wireless-power-transmission-emrod-interview/?itm_source=newatlas&amp;itm_medium=article-body</a></p>",energy,Incident management,,building,,1 - operational work,2 - near to realisation,3 - less credible,"<div class=""ExternalClass59F900E9F7BE45E1BF3883812B448404"">energy infrastructure Emrod Powerco &quot;New Zealand&quot; spectrum wifi bluetooth cable wire copper metal resources transmission incident microwave material metamaterial &quot;Nikolai Tesla&quot;</div>",Yes,Yes,No,No,No,,energy,Incident management,0,0,[],18/05/2022 11:45,"Loveday, Tim",26/05/2021 16:15,"Loveday, Tim",0,,,,,Jason Dinsdale

14960,21/10/2020,Jason Dinsdale,"New research suggests that direct air capture technologies (DAC) could exacerbate demand for energy and water, yet overall would help to avoid rising food costs from land use competition between bioenergy, afforestation and farming.","<div class=""ExternalClassFFB10341FA0242EC94031EA6F3C83B2B"">DAC may be an essential strategy in negative emissions technologies (NETs) if the UK wishes to successfully realise its Net Zero ambitions, and may be an emerging sector requiring regulation. DAC is an engineered separation process that uses aqueous or amine sorbents to remove CO2 from ambient air, compress it and inject it into geologic reservoirs. DAC is currently not sufficiently factored into carbon capture plans, which mainly focus on bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and afforestation. Both approaches create clashes with themselves and other land uses, including food production and biodiversity. DAC offers a solution but is itself reliant on energy and water resources. However DAC can help ameliorate food-water-energy trade-offs when deployed alongside BECCS and afforestation, particularly if renewable energy is scaled up to power it. Delaying introducing DAC approaches could lead to worse issues around energy and water further down the line and increase reliance on BECCS and afforestation, increasing pressures on crops and habitats. DACs effectively provides a ‘backstop’ on the cost of dealing with carbon and could start to remove multiple GtCO2 yr−1 from the atmosphere as early as 2035. Unlike bioenergy and forestry DACs are reasonably independent of location, requiring only a suitable geological storage. The physical footprint of these units would be much smaller than BECCS or afforestation, and it would not require any particular land type, only proximity to a geologic reservoir for storage. The regions with the greatest potential are the USA, China, South America and Australia, where there is suitable geology, plenty of natural gas supplies and further potential for transition to renewable energies. DACs solutions may also appear within the UK. There is the potential also for chemical impacts on water from the chemistry of storing carbon dioxide underground. Such impacts, alongside the potential for a new regulatory remit for the Environment Agency may need to be considered.</div>","<div class=""ExternalClass9BB3FDD4A8854C02B18CA15A28FE25AF"">https&%2358;//www.nature.com/articles/s41558-020-0876-z</div>",<div>Food–energy–water implications of negative emissions technologies in a +1.5 °C future</div>,Nature,24/08/2020,"Fuhrman, J; et al","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//interestingengineering.com/startup-sucks-carbon-from-the-air-turns-it-into-rock"">Startup Sucks Carbon From the Air, Turns It Into Rock | IE (interestingengineering.com)</a></p>",climate,Climate change,,water1,,1 - operational work,4 - signficant development needed,1 - Highly credible,"<div class=""ExternalClassCD7C23EEA5054BA1B902CA8550AFB6C7"">&quot;climate change&quot; &quot;direct air capture&quot; DAC &quot;negative emissions technologies&quot; NETs &quot;bioenergy with carbon capture and storage&quot; BECCS afforestation biodiversity energy water farming food renewable gas China USA &quot;South America&quot; Australia geology &quot;water quality&quot; chemistry chemical regulation emission CO2 &quot;carbon dioxide&quot; 2035</div>",Yes,Yes,No,No,No,,climate,Climate change,0,0,[],18/05/2022 11:45,"Loveday, Tim",26/05/2021 16:15,"Loveday, Tim",0,,,,,Jason Dinsdale
14959,20/10/2020,Jason Dinsdale,"As corporations, regions and nation states make public pledges on achieving Net Zero, one company commits to putting more water back into ecosystems than it consumes.​","<div class=""ExternalClassFF9C4877312F438E8E65E724F15E9587"">The Environment Agency as a regulator of the water environment should be interested in this early example of “net positive water” and consider the impacts of  how this movement could develop. Retail giant Walmart has announced that it will reach Net Zero in its global operations by 2040, without offsetting. It’s strategies for achieving this include a commitment to renewable energy and electrifying its vehicle fleet, using low energy cooling systems and habitat restoration of terrestrial and marine ecosystems. The state of California has vowed to ban the sale of gasoline powered vehicles from 2035, joining 15 other nations who have made similar pledges. This clashes with the pro-fossil fuel policies of President Donald Trump’s White House. China recently announced that it’s emissions will peak in 2030 before achieving carbon neutrality by 2060. China is the world's biggest source of carbon dioxide, responsible for around 28% of global emissions. Building on this trend for environmentally positive pledges Microsoft recently announced that it intends to achieve a net positive water footprint by 2030, meaning it intends to contribute more energy back into the environment in the places it operates than it is drawing out across all river basins inside its footprint. This will be achieved through reducing the intensity of water use across its operations, measured in amount of water consumed per megawatt of energy. Secondly Microsoft intends to replenish water into water stressed areas through investment in area wetland restoration, removing and replacing non water-permeable surfaces such as asphalt, which prevent rainfall absorption. Microsoft intends to use artificial intelligence (AI)to provide identify and optimise where their efforts will have greatest impact. With some areas of the UK already water stressed the Environment Agency and partners may wish to consider how investment from the private sector could help achieve net positive water footprint, should other companies or organisations decide to follow Microsoft’s example.<br></div>","<div class=""ExternalClassFC404CE85F164A5284F7B2A27B2E65A4"">https&%2358;//www.reuters.com/article/us-autos-california-emissions/california-to-ban-sale-of-new-gasoline-powered-passenger-vehicles-starting-2035-idUSKCN26E33N?il=0%5C<br>&%23160;</div>",<div>California sets goal to ban sale of new gasoline-powered passenger vehicles starting in 2035</div>,Reuters,24/09/2020,"Shepardson, D & Groom, N","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//electrek.co/2020/09/22/egeb-walmart-net-zero-2040-suntober-maine-solar/"">https&%2358;//electrek.co/2020/09/22/egeb-walmart-net-zero-2040-suntober-maine-solar/</a></p> <p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-54256826"">https&%2358;//electrek.co/2020/09/22/egeb-walmart-net-zero-2040-suntober-maine-solar/</a></p> <p><a href=""https&%2358;//techcrunch.com/2020/09/21/microsoft-commits-to-putting-more-water-than-it-consumes-back-into-the-ecosystems-where-it-operates-by-2030/"">https&%2358;//techcrunch.com/2020/09/21/microsoft-commits-to-putting-more-water-than-it-consumes-back-into-the-ecosystems-where-it-operates-by-2030/</a></p>",water1,Water Resources,,climate,,1 - operational work,5 - conceptual,2 - credible,"<div class=""ExternalClass1D072491C1F34E3A8B33C0C2096BFC9E"">water resources &quot;net zero&quot; &quot;net positive water footprint&quot; Microsoft Walmart China California 2030 2040 2060 2035 energy basin &quot;climate change&quot; USA &quot;Donald Trump&quot; &quot;fossil fuel&quot; petrol gasoline vehicle engine car EV electric vehicle run-off asphalt megawatt investment regulation nautral capital habitat</div>",Yes,Yes,No,No,No,,water,Water Resources,0,0,[],18/05/2022 11:45,"Loveday, Tim",26/05/2021 16:15,"Loveday, Tim",0,,,,,Jason Dinsdale
14958,16/10/2020,Jason Dinsdale,One of the many legacies of the coronavirus pandemic could be significant changes to current acceptable geographical barriers to employment and education.,"<div class=""ExternalClass8D787871854445689A070F01C4AC16E1"">The Environment Agency could be impacted by these changes as all employers will be and could lose a competitive edge without changing terms and conditions to mirror emerging societal expectations. National lockdowns have provided a catalyst for accelerating the move to remote working across the globe. Many organisations are planning to continue with a significant remote working presence. Nearly three quarters of UK company directors said they would be keeping increased home-working after coronavirus, while 43% have embraced aspects of flexible working such as compressed hours. Many employees experienced reduced hours during lockdown&%2358; evidence suggests that reducing the length of the working week could help to save jobs&%2358; a four-day week could save half a million jobs in the public sector alone (it’s worth noting that the two day weekend was introduced in the 1930s to stimulate employment). While this is not a novel proposition the idea of alternative working practices has gained greater focus in the wake of Covid-19. Similar ideas are being discussed in education circles, including formalising rights to remote working to ensure that there is flexibility and resilience to learning, in the event of future systematic shocks. As work and education become less reliance on presence and more on connectivity, responses are emerging. Croatia is on the verge of being one of the first countries to offer Digital Nomad visas. These will allow and encourage workers who need nothing more than a good internet connection to work. The visa will encourage people regardless of citizenship the right to work in Croatia for up to 12 months, in return stimulating the local economy. The American hospitality industry has been responding to the current crisis through the notion of the ‘Schoolcation’. With many students learning remotely, families are looking to take their families on vacation at a time of year when it would typically not be practical, saving money in the process. Hotels are in turn offering distance-learning vacations that includes dedicated “classroom” space for connecting to lessons back home and private tutors and tech support, plus extra-curricular educational activities. If such concepts become more mainstream then the Environment Agency’s workforce could be impacted. It could mean that seasonal impacts on productivity and availability become muted. Employee wellbeing may improve, and there may be a reappraisal of salary demands alongside changes to terms and conditions.  It could also mean that employment conditions around geography and citizenship make the Environment Agency a less attractive employee next to other organisations, and may also make some roles harder to recruit for. It may also drive a distinct difference in working practices between field and office staff.</div>","<div class=""ExternalClass97448A33EF864F91AFF81587439E0BE5"">https&%2358;//www.wired.co.uk/article/four-day-week-coronavirus<br>&%23160;</div>",<div>Coronavirus has shown why we need a four-day working week</div>,Wired,07/09/2020,"Bernal, N","<p><a href=""http&%2358;//www.impactlab.net/2020/09/08/schoolcations-are-the-latest-hotel-trend-to-attract-remote-learners/"">http&%2358;//www.impactlab.net/2020/09/08/schoolcations-are-the-latest-hotel-trend-to-attract-remote-learners/</a></p> <p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.total-croatia-news.com/digital-nomads-in-croatia/46639-digital-nomad-visa"">https&%2358;//www.total-croatia-news.com/digital-nomads-in-croatia/46639-digital-nomad-visa</a></p> <p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-54363069"">https&%2358;//www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-54363069</a></p> <p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.iod.com/news-campaigns/news/articles/Home-working-here-to-stay-new-IoD-figures-suggest"">https&%2358;//www.iod.com/news-campaigns/news/articles/Home-working-here-to-stay-new-IoD-figures-suggest</a></p>","social aspects, population",Workforce,,economics1,,1 - operational work,4 - signficant development needed,2 - credible,"<div class=""ExternalClass7D2F7566EF064741AA791EBB1A5D55AA"">workforce leave vacation education employment employer employee schoolcation &quot;digital nomad&quot; visa Croatia USA America coronavirus Covid-19 lockdown remote working citizenship nationality</div>",Yes,Yes,No,No,No,,"social aspects, population",Workforce,0,0,[],18/05/2022 11:45,"Loveday, Tim",26/05/2021 16:15,"Loveday, Tim",0,,,,,Jason Dinsdale
14957,13/10/2020,Jason Dinsdale,Several new developments highlight that a merge of ‘man and machine’ may be coming ever closer.,"<div class=""ExternalClass65BD5C11A34944E69A22AED1AA946DD6"">Tech entrepreneur Elon Musk recently generated headlines with a demonstration of a brain computer interface called ‘Neuralink’, developed by Musk’s company of the same age. Neuralink is a coin sized device that would be placed in contact with the top of the brain through a robot conducted operation. It is charged via induction. Musk also displayed three pigs representing a ‘before, during and after’ of Neuralink function and removal. Intended applications could include humans to control computers and phones and access information with just their thoughts. It may also help treat neurological disorders including memory and hearing loss, blindness to paralysis, depression and brain damage. The technology is still in its early stages, but the apparent simplification of insertion and use may prove an important step forward. Such interfaces however may not require surgery in the brain. A successful experiment in Australia was able to wirelessly restore the transmission of brain impulses out of the body of patients with upper limb paralysis, enabling them to complete daily tasks such as online banking, shopping and texting, which previously had not been available to them. The Strentrode implant was placed alongside their brain’s motor cortex via keyhole surgery in the neck. Another brain computer interface has been developed that uses artificial intelligence to generate images based on faces that people were looking at. The system was trained on analysis of brain waves generated from people looking at a range of faces. Scientists in China have developed an implantable data storage material made from silk proteins. The silk has a capacity of 64 GB per square inch and can operate under harsh conditions including bacterial contamination, high humidity, high magnetic fields and clinical-level gamma radiation. Infrared light etches information onto the silk, which was still retrievable after 30 minutes of high level microwave exposure.  Due to the biocompatible nature of the organic material it could be used to store personalised medical information, but further development is needed to match current data extraction speeds. Australian doctors are preparing to trial a bionic eye that may be able to restore vision to the blind. ‘Gennaris’, which includes a camera and a wireless transmitter bypasses damaged optic nerves, allowing the retina to transmit signals to the brain. It is hoped that Gennaris will have medical applications to restore blindness. Successful transplants in sheep may pave the way for human trails in the future. While there are some significant potential medical benefits of these and similar technologies there may also be moral and ethical issues should the technology become more prevalent, for example around data ownership and personal privacy. To focus on the operational implications there may be issues around the security of such devices, for example there have previously been concerns around the prospect of ‘brainjacking’ (%23*****). Technologically enhanced senses could bring the ability to ‘see’ ‘smell’ or ‘hear’ outside of normal human parameters, which may have applications in monitoring and surveillance.

Utilising sodium nanofluid, it is possible to recover so called “heavy oil” in a more sustainable way; this low-cost and sustainable nanofluid removes the need for heat, hence reducing green gas production in the process, and the sodium dissipates automatically following the chemical reaction, with no contamination by chemicals in environment. Approximately 70% of the world’s global oil reserves consist of heavy oil, characterised by high viscosity but the sodium nanofluid technology can be used for recovery of any viscosity type oil. The researchers note that the recovery in the field is likely to be less efficient than in the laboratory conditions, also impacted by the conditions of the oilfield. The type of solvent the sodium nanofluid is mixed with also impacts the oil recovery rate.<br>The researchers from Houston focused on the enhanced oil recovery in the oil fields, but this nanotechnology could be used to make light oil, for instance mixing sodium nanofluid with silicone oil, for households uses such as clearing pipes blocked by grease.<br></div>","<div class=""ExternalClass111B5089363645B9B5A7BFCB0DE55D30"">https&%2358;//www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-09/uoh-inn091020.php</div><div class=""ExternalClass111B5089363645B9B5A7BFCB0DE55D30"">&%23160;</div><div class=""ExternalClass111B5089363645B9B5A7BFCB0DE55D30"">&%23160;</div>","<div>Inexpensive, non-toxic nanofluid could be a game-changer for oil recovery</div>",EurekAlert!,10/09/2020,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,"<p><a href=""https&%2358;//doi.org/10.1016/j.mtphys.2020.100276?"">https&%2358;//doi.org/10.1016/j.mtphys.2020.100276?</a></p>",pollution1,oil pollution,,soil,,4 - possible future remit,2 - near to realisation,2 - credible,"<div class=""ExternalClassF21F5BC5DD6F4A22A2A7F33494D26C75"">pollution petroleum oil contamination remediation “oil recovery” technology nanotechnology nanofluid pipes hydrogen sodium&%23160;</div>",No,Yes,No,No,No,,pollution,Incident management,0,0,[],18/05/2022 11:45,"Loveday, Tim",26/05/2021 16:15,"Loveday, Tim",0,,,,,Liisa Tang

Instead of increasing waste import for burning from countries such as the UK and Germany, which accounted for third of the waste burnt in 2018, Denmark has plans to overhaul their entire waste management system, to comply with their new climate law, with the aim to reduce incineration, to cut greenhouse gas emissions and to move to offshore wind power for their electricity and heating needs. <br>Previous investment in building incinerators was seen as an improvement in comparison to landfills or shipping waste to other countries, yet the process increases CO2 emissions. As increased recycling and circular economy incentives are now mainstream and are reducing waste burnt in incinerators, new plans are needed for energy production, in particular for district heating in Denmark where 60% of households use district heating, generated from incinerating municipal solid waste. This also impacts us when Denmark is no longer accepting waste from the UK and is improving recycling further.

Many coastal ecosystems are in decline around the World. At the same time the ecosystem benefits of habitats are being recognised, such as salt marsh from a flood defence perspective. Many coastal plants have ‘emergent traits’, meaning that while they are resilient in large numbers, individual plants can easily be swept away. This can make re-establishing habitats challenging. One experimental approach has used biodegradable mats made with the by-products of potato processing to help restore seagrass meadows - the same approach could also work with salt marshes and other coastal ecosystems. By mimicking stems or roots, the mats protect the young plants. As the plant matures the mats disappear. A similar approach is being used to encourage coral reef growth with 3D printed terracotta tiles. The interlocking textured hexagonal tiles create a structurally complex foundation for coral attachment and to prevent sedimentation, one of the major threats to corals.Tiles seeded with coral fragments have already been deployed. The production of the tiles themselve is more environmentally friendly than similar structures in concrete or metal. Artificial reef tiles such as these could help to conserve reef biodiversity worldwide. A similar approach may also be of benefit to other marine habitats. <br></div>","<div class=""ExternalClass54EEA3541DE94B319283C8577D30D20F"">https&%2358;//www.wur.nl/en/news-wur/show-home/Improving-coastal-restoration-by-temporarily-imitating-nature.htm<br>&%23160;</div>",<div>Improving coastal restoration by temporarily imitating nature</div>,Wageningen University & Research,27/07/2020,,"<p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.3dprintingmedia.network/hku-architects-and-marine-scientists-co-develop-novel-3d-printed-reef-tiles/"">https&%2358;//www.3dprintingmedia.network/hku-architects-and-marine-scientists-co-develop-novel-3d-printed-reef-tiles/</a></p> <p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.bbc.com/future/article/20200811-the-eco-friendly-alternatives-to-ocean-concrete"">https&%2358;//www.bbc.com/future/article/20200811-the-eco-friendly-alternatives-to-ocean-concrete</a></p> <p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-11/cuoh-ete110520.php"">https&%2358;//www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-11/cuoh-ete110520.php</a></p> <p><a href=""https&%2358;//newatlas.com/biology/sea-walls-3d-printed-tiles/"">https&%2358;//newatlas.com/biology/sea-walls-3d-printed-tiles/</a></p> <p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.dezeen.com/2021/03/05/coastalock-rock-pools-san-diego-bay-econcrete/"">https&%2358;//www.dezeen.com/2021/03/05/coastalock-rock-pools-san-diego-bay-econcrete/</a></p>","natural areas, landscape, ecosystems",Biodiversity,,"disasters, accidents, risk",,1 - operational work,2 - near to realisation,2 - credible,"<p class=""ExternalClass38E70E0FE32941F3A3A06C2D93B36986"">biodiversity habitat nature salt marsh seagrass &quot;3D printing&quot; &quot;emergent traits&quot; biodegradable terracotta concrete “self-healing concrete” strength coral reef flood ecosystem artificial</p>",No,Yes,No,No,No,,"natural areas, landscape, ecosystems",Biodiversity,0,0,[],18/05/2022 11:45,"Loveday, Tim",26/05/2021 16:15,"Loveday, Tim",0,,,,,Jason Dinsdale

14949,07/10/2020,Jason Dinsdale,UK psychiatrists are proposing that adding lithium to tap water could help address mental health issues.,"<div class=""ExternalClassE25181DACAC64B4FA13520F3AFFF09BE"">The Environment Agency may wish to consider the implications of this on water quality and aquatic wildlife while it is still in a conceptual stage. Previously it has been highlighted that adding lithium to tap water could help to address issues of depression in some areas (%23***** - need to rewrite this sentence when HSDBi online). The latest research a UK research team found a strong link between geographical areas with high levels of lithium in public drinking water and lower suicide rates. This suggests that higher trace levels of lithium in drinking water may exert an anti-suicidal effect, potentially to improve community mental health. Lithium has been used in psychiatric treatment since the 1940s as a mood stabiliser. Previous studies suggest that lithium can be highly bioavailable to fish, and can influence gill activity in rainbow trout, but that water chemistry, particularly sodium concentrations, can influence this.  Measures to address public health in this way could add to lithium levels downstream of sewage treatment, if not removed, and impact on fish and other organisms.

14948,07/10/2020,Jason Dinsdale,It may soon be possible to visit space in a six hour balloon trip.,"<div class=""ExternalClassA73D025D73B840378FECE7023C6B830F"">New developments in space travel should be of interest to the Environment Agency as any launch activities may have regulatory implications, particularly where there is combustion, fuel and emissions. Currently there is already regulatory activity around this embryonic industry such as Newquay, Cornwall. Space tourism and payload deployment is anticipated to be a growth industry globally, with the many business models based on combustion and propulsion, either directly from the ground or from planes. Start up Space Perspective is taking a different approach based around a high altitude balloon called Spaceship Neptune. Their design consists of a pressurised capsule suspended below a hydrogen balloon. The capsule can carry eight passengers over a six hour flight at the anticipated price of $125,000, half of that offered by other space tourism operators. Moving to this model for space tourism could conceivable change the regulatory effort and mechanisms applied to the sector. Another development which could also impact on current assumptions of the growing space sector can be seen through China’s development of a floating spaceport for rocket launches. The Eastern Aerospace Port is being developed off the coast of Haiyang city in Shandong province. The American company SpaceX is similarly looking to develop off-shore launch facilities which reduce the risk to populated areas near to terrestrial launch sites. The prospect of offshore launch facilities in UK waters could alter or indeed remove the regulatory remit for the Environment Agency in this sector, but present a different set of potential environmental impacts that currently anticipated. The prospect of launch capabilities in international waters also suggest that space launches may sit outside of any regulatory remit, despite concerns that not enough is currently known about the environmental impact of rocket emissions (%23*****).</div>","<div class=""ExternalClassE0D31D64B23D4E16BF55AA71DA78F69D"">https&%2358;//www.designindaba.com/articles/creative-work/discover-new-perspective-earth-spaceship-neptune<br>&%23160;</div>",<div>Discover a new perspective of Earth with Spaceship Neptune</div>,Design Indaba,16/07/2020,,"<p><a href=""https&%2358;//futurism.com/the-byte/china-building-floating-spaceport-rockets"">https&%2358;//futurism.com/the-byte/china-building-floating-spaceport-rockets</a></p>",transport,space transportation,,pollution1,,1 - operational work,5 - conceptual,3 - less credible,"<div class=""ExternalClassB1CBDC9076F5458EA25F66011A76ACC6"">regulation space air pollution launch tourism transport balloon China marine sea spaceport rocket offshore SpaceX &quot;Eastern Aerospace Port&quot; &quot;Spaceship Neptune&quot; &quot;Space Perspective&quot; Haiyang hydrogen</div>",Yes,Yes,No,No,No,,0,Regulation,0,0,[],18/05/2022 11:45,"Loveday, Tim",26/05/2021 16:15,"Loveday, Tim",0,,,,,Jason Dinsdale

KFC has collaborated with 3D Bioprinting Solutions to produce the World’s first bioprinted chicken nuggets. The nuggets are produced from a meat cultured from a single cell sample, plus plant based ingredients. The product isn’t technically vegetarian because of this, but no animals are further harmed or killed during production. KFC believes that their approach could reduce energy consumption by half, greenhouse gas emissions 25 fold and land use by a factor of 100 compared to traditional meat production. This echoes a wider trend to move away from livestock farming. Meat and dairy still remain significant sources of human calories, but health and environmental concerns see tastes moving to alternatives. The coronavirus pandemic seems to have accelerated this trend as disruptions to supply, sick workers and higher prices led to consumers looking for alternatives. By way of example the USA saw plant-based meat sales surge 264% in the 9 weeks ended May 2nd 2020, and in the first week of March 2020, oat milk sales were up 347% year-over-year against a backdrop of declining dairy demand. As dairy sales continue to decrease and plant based milk sales increase, examples are emerging of some dairy farmers embracing a switch to arable in order to serve both markets. Plant milk companies such as Oatly have announced partnerships to help dairy farmers transition. Dairy companies are also adding plant based milk to their portfolios. Some farmers are splitting their land between pasture and crop. Dairy milk has a much greater carbon, land and water footprint than plant based milk, but plant based milk has been associated with pesticide use and biodiversity issues, though there are also sustainable examples in existence. Transition programmes allow farmers to continue to earn a living off the land whilst continuing to serve similar markets, and demonstrate that as the livestock industry slowly wanes that both approaches can be complementary rather than in competition whilst maintaining a focus on positive environmental outcomes.</div>","<div class=""ExternalClass77CAA9EE699A452CB8BE80DF8F67D9F4"">https&%2358;//interestingengineering.com/kfc-to-3d-bioprint-chicken-nuggets-soon<br>&%23160;</div>",<div>KFC to 3D bioprint chicken nuggets soon</div>,Interesting Engineering,19/07/2020,"Papadopoulos, L","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//ensia.com/features/plant-milk-dairy-soy-almond-rice-oat-hemp-farmers/"">https&%2358;//ensia.com/features/plant-milk-dairy-soy-almond-rice-oat-hemp-farmers/</a></p> <p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.cbinsights.com/research/future-of-meat-industrial-farming/?"">https&%2358;//www.cbinsights.com/research/future-of-meat-industrial-farming/?</a></p>",agriculture,Farming,,animal husbandry,,1 - operational work,2 - near to realisation,3 - less credible,"<div class=""ExternalClassF07F362A76BD456BB55183A003C2E69B"">food farming livestock poultry meat chicken milk Covid-19 coronavirus regulation dairy land use nutrition</div>",Yes,Yes,No,No,No,,agriculture,Farming,0,0,[],18/05/2022 11:45,"Loveday, Tim",26/05/2021 16:15,"Loveday, Tim",0,,,,,Jason Dinsdale

Determining qualitative landscapes, rather than being in the eye of the beholder actually has common understandings, widely accepted across different cultures. This same consensus has been modelled within the AI system, allowing it to recognise spatial clusters which can be reinforced through ground truthing. This in turn can be used to automatically delineate land units to build up a comprehensive picture of widely accepted landscape typologies, which can inform spatial planning and conservation decisions. Similar systems could be useful in automating natural capital and ecosystems assessments. However the notions of beauty are being continuously constructed and re-constructed.  An intervention like this may risk shaping expectations of what can be considered ‘beautiful’ and ‘valuable’ potentially limiting aspirations for environmental improvement in the long term without a considered application.</div>","<div class=""ExternalClassE72D2FDFF98E40DB9C05CC3367FF066E"">https&%2358;//ethz.ch/content/main/en/news-and-events/eth-news/news/2020/06/blog-gret-regamey-landscape-ai.html</div>",<div>Who’s evaluating Swiss landscapes?</div>,ETH Zurich,19/06/2020,,,"natural areas, landscape, ecosystems",conservation policy,,administration,,2 - advisory work,1 - realised,2 - credible,"<div class=""ExternalClass6EDBA4C9415A4081A36767B3C908FD3F"">&quot;artificial intelligence&quot; AI landscape mapping biodiversity beauty &quot;nautral capital&quot; landuse</div>",No,Yes,No,No,No,,"natural areas, landscape, ecosystems",0,0,0,[],18/05/2022 11:45,"Loveday, Tim",26/05/2021 16:15,"Loveday, Tim",0,,,,,Jason Dinsdale

Falling fertility rates globally could mean that almost every country experiences a drop in population by the end of the century. This means that global population is expected to peak at around 9.7 billion in 2064, before falling to  8.8 billion by the end of the century, going against many expectations that populations will continue to grow. The UK is predicted to peak at 75 million in 2063, and fall to 71 million by 2100. Globally women had  on average 2.7 children in 2017, compared to 4.7 in 1950. This number is expected to fall below the sustaining level of 2.1 to 1.7 by 2100. The driving force behind this is thought to be women having better access to education, work and contraception. Some countries, particularly those with a markedly ageing population could see dramatic population crashes by the end of the century. This could have significant repercussions for ageing populations, reducing both the tax base and labour force need to support their care. Immigration is one possible solution, with African countries possibly holding surplus labour. There is also emerging evidence that the economic uncertainty that the coronavirus pandemic has caused could further impact birth rates, leading to 500,000 less births in 2021, possibly further compounding the trend. A manifestation of a smaller population could challenge the current long term strategic and planning assumptions behind many areas of the Environment Agency’s work, such as flood management, water resources and land use.</div>","<div class=""ExternalClassDBCC22A4ED1041BBBA96E4B315A1ADB3"">https&%2358;//futurism.com/global-birth-rates-falling-precipitiously<br>&%23160;</div>",<div>Researchers say Earth is headed for “jaw-dropping” population decline</div>,Futurism,15/07/2020,"Tangermann, V","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-53409521"">https&%2358;//www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-53409521</a></p> <p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.brookings.edu/research/half-a-million-fewer-children-the-coming-covid-baby-bust/"">https&%2358;//www.brookings.edu/research/half-a-million-fewer-children-the-coming-covid-baby-bust/</a></p> <p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2820%2930677-2/fulltext?"">https&%2358;//www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30677-2/fulltext?</a></p>","social aspects, population",demography,,economics1,,2 - advisory work,1 - realised,1 - Highly credible,"<div class=""ExternalClass4B9CB8C9655143B1AD8C1DDB1A147308"">population demographic fertlity birth Covid-19 coronavirus women education employment Africa workforce labour ageing care economy tax pension flooding water resources regulation urban development land use</div>",Yes,Yes,No,No,No,,"social aspects, population",0,0,0,[],18/05/2022 11:45,"Loveday, Tim",26/05/2021 16:15,"Loveday, Tim",0,,,,,Jason Dinsdale

The study showed that extremely low concentrations (microdoses) of Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) of around 500 micrograms administered three times a day was an effective pain reliever. Typically  medical doses of cannabis are one  gram of 15 per cent THC cannabis per day, equivalent to 150,000 micrograms of THC. The study therefore demonstrates that much lower doses could be as effective as those currently prescribed. The study could pave the way for more standardised use of cannabinoids in medical treatment, which in turn may lead to a more widespread environmental presence, though there may be a trade off between current levels of exposure and future lower medical doses.

Normally this conversion takes place on separate microchips. In the new microchip electronic and photonic components sit tightly on top of one another, shortening transmission paths and reducing signal loss - termed  ‘monolithic co-​integration’. The realisation of this microchip signifies that plasmonics, a branch of photonics, could provide the foundation for ultrafast chips. Such components are needed to serve the growing demand for faster data flow to meet demand for services such as high-​speed internet, digital telephony, and video and audio streaming. In a separate breakthrough researchers have achieved “breakneck” internet around one million times faster than current speeds. This has been achieved via a new cable containing a microcomb, which replaces the conventional array of lasers used to transmit data via fibre optic cable. The microcomb generates very sharp and equidistant frequency lines in a tiny microphotonic chip, which results in data flowing faster. The microcomb is compatible with current telecommunications infrastructure. Average internet speed in the USA is 50.2 megabits per second. The microcomb generated speeds of 44.2 terabits per second. Roll out of these technologies would impact all internet usage, including the Environment Agency’s.

Around the World environmentally focussed work is carried out by people who are either poorly paid or not paid at all. Reforestation, precious metal and mineral recovery and forest firefighting to name some activities are carried out with little or no wages to speak of - Defra itself is cited as relying heavily on volunteer labour for flood management. This situation creates concepts such as ‘green gig-economy’ and ‘eco-precariat’, suggesting that mobilising the labour force needed to realise global environmental protection and climate change adaptation requires careful consideration to ensure that this work is appropriately valued in terms of wages and health, safety and wellbeing protection. This is particularly acute where voluntary work has risk associated with it, such as fighting wildfires, which are increasing in frequency and scale. With increasing pressures on the military (%23*****), there are risks in relying on volunteers for this increasingly critical work. Schemes that utilise prison labour are already established in some countries (%23*****), but these also come with health and safety considerations. As with other aspects of human labour automation may have a role to play in complementing or competing with the green economy workforce. This is exemplified by Dendra, a start-up that intends to use technology to increase tree planting. Dendra uses a combination of image capture and artificial intelligence to map and assess degraded land to create restoration plans unique to a site’s ecological conditions. Drones are then used to plant seeds at the rate of  120 seeds a minute per drone, claimed to be significantly faster than traditional manual planting methods.In light of the reliance on green gig economy and eco-precariat concepts the Environment Agency and partners may have to consider the full picture of the environmental workforce, both paid and unpaid, in order to ensure future resilience in objective delivery. <br></div>","<div class=""ExternalClassBF2271188B2940D492B4CDC7E0FC772E"">https&%2358;//theconversation.com/the-green-gig-economy-precarious-workers-are-on-the-frontline-of-climate-change-fight-133392<br><br>&%23160;</div>",<div>The green gig economy&%2358; precarious workers are on the frontline of climate change fight</div>,The Conversation,21/04/2020,"Mahanty, S & Neimark, B","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.siliconrepublic.com/machines/dendra-funding-drones-biodiversity?"">https&%2358;//www.siliconrepublic.com/machines/dendra-funding-drones-biodiversity?</a></p>",climate,Climate change,,climate,,1 - operational work,1 - realised,2 - credible,<div>&quot;Climate change&quot; biodiversity workforce labour costs reforestation flooding incident volunteer prison &quot;green gig economy&quot; &quot;eco-precariat&quot; automation drone Dendra</div>,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,,climate,Climate change,0,0,[],18/05/2022 11:45,"Loveday, Tim",26/05/2021 16:14,"Loveday, Tim",0,,,,,Jason Dinsdale

14940,07/10/2020,Jason Dinsdale,There are signs that urban farming is starting to scale as three large projects come to light.,"<div>A growing move towards urban agriculture and food production could mean the Environment Agency needs to refocus regulatory activities within both sectors away from rural settings. Thammasat University in Bangkok, Thailand recently unveiled the largest rooftop garden in Asia. The 22,000 square metre garden has been conceived for climate resilience and will grow organic produce, including rice without pesticides or fertilisers. A water management system that captures rainwater which is stored and re-used to water the fields and grow food. Any leftover water is filtered and led to one of four retention ponds, which are a back-up in case of drought. The World’s largest urban rooftop farm is currently under construction in Paris. The farm will grow soil free produce without pesticides or fungicides and reducing water use by 90 per cent vertically over a 14,000 sq metre site, where 20 staff will harvest up to 1,000kg up to 35 different varieties of fruit and vegetables, every day. The coronavirus pandemic has helped to illustrate the resilience that urban farming can bring to local communities. The World’s largest rooftop greenhouse now spans 15,000 square metres in Montreal, Canada. The greenhouse will meet growing demand for locally sourced foods, producing enough food to feed 10,000 families.

 and the resulting shock wave is monitored as it propagates back up through the pipe. Statistical techniques are then used to interpret the data and narrow down the possible area the leak could be in. At the moment that’s a slow computational process conducted

 by computers and accuracy is a problem. To improve it statisticians at Stanford have now developed a Bayesian approach that both improves the accuracy of the end results and significantly reduces the amount of computational time required to get there. The

14934,10/09/2020,Liisa Tang,Public acceptance of future technologies for food production is essential,"Some of the novel technologies that are required to ensure significantly greater food supply, food security and sustainability in the next thirty years may not be easily accepted by the consumers due to a variety of negative perceptions associated with

 them. Yet we won’t be able to increase food production by the necessary 30-70% globally unless we can introduce technologies such as artificial intelligence, robotics, genetically modified organisms (GMOs), micro-algae production, aquaponics and vertical farming

 - their use necessitates them being accepted by consumers. Other future solutions for food security include nitrogen-fixating cereals that can reduce the use of chemicals, biodegradable polymers and the breeding of insects for animal feed and foodstuffs. Due

 to public’s lack of familiarity with most of these food technologies, even if majority of them are already fully developed, people often rely on simple heuristics when evaluating them. Therefore, in order to generate public support, transparency and clear

 information with the public with a buy-in from the politicians is crucial to enable the change. The consumers’ acceptance or lack of acceptance depends on a variety of factors such as cultural values, more diversity among the consumers, their need to be able

 to stockpile for future crises etc. and these differ across food technologies. The “natural-is-better” perception can make some technologies seem unnatural or controversial to them, and the food produced through this technology seem disgusting, unsafe, unhealthy

 or unnatural to many, not just the neophobic consumers. Taking into account the factors influencing consumers’ perceptions of novel food technologies during the early stage of development and introduction, then later adapting and developing further, indicates

14933,08/09/2020,Jason Dinsdale,Several examples of how developments of materials at the microscopic and nanoscopic scale could deliver benefits in tackling pollution.,"These may be of interest to the Environment Agency from a regulatory position but also as possible tactics for dealing with the effects of pollution incidents. Previously ‘smart’ materials that target pollutants of interest (%2314283) and nano-sponges (%2314306)

 have come to light. Researchers have recently developed a new nano-sponge fabrication technique that greatly reduces costs, bringing the prospect of real world applications ever closer. Currently nano-sponges are constructed through a slow 3D printing technique

 that only produced small quantities. The new method instead blended two liquid polymers into a finely distributed emulsion, which harden before one of the two components is dissolved to leave behind a network of extremely fine labyrinthine pores. This is then

 coated in aluminium oxide before dissolving, the second polymer component, leaving behind a nano‑network of extremely thin “shells” of aluminium oxide. The method allows nano-sponges to be produced at the centimetre scale, so there this still progress to be

 made until commercial scale production. The resulting material is as strong as steel yet is extremely light and can be compressed multiple times. Another team of researchers have created a reusable ‘smart’ nano-sponge that can absorb up to 30 times its own

 weight of oil at a time. A nano-composite coating of magnetic nano-structures and a carbon-based substrate that is Oleophilic (attracts oil), Hydrophobic (resists water) and Magnetic (OHM). is applied to a regular commercially available sponge. The nano-composite's

 nano-porous three-dimensional structure selectively interacts with and binds to the oil molecules. Currently used solutions to oil spill clean up include burning, using chemical dispersants, skimming oil or absorbing it with unrecyclable sorbents, all of which

 have their disadvantages, including cost, which the new sponge addresses. Oil can even be collected and sold back to the polluter. The OHM slurry may also have a second life as an anode for lithium ion batteries, another potential source of revenue. The team

 is also developing sponges that can selectively absorb other substances such as phosphates, from fertiliser runoff and agricultural pollution. A third project sees scientists experimenting with pollen based microrobots that target mercury pollution. Some pollen

 grains are already known to have an affinity with mercury. Researchers used pollen from a plants, including dandelion, pine, lotus, sunflower, poppy, camellia, lycopodium and cattail. The pollen was cleaned before a platinum particle was attach to one side

 of each pollen grain. The pollen was added to water containing mercury. Hydrogen peroxide was also added to the water. Hydrogen peroxide reacted with the platinum to form a chemical motor for each pollen grain. Similar propulsion methods for pollution cleaning

 microbots have been tested previously ( %2313907, %2313447). After two hours in solution at 80 per cent of the mercury had been absorbed. Grains from a lotus flower had the highest velocity in the water – about 78 centimetres per hour – while cattail adsorbed

 the most mercury – around 90 per cent. The next step is to use enzymes to power the microrobots. All these developments suggest pathways for improved and more efficient water treatment, pollution clean up and pollution incident response, if further realised

 and may therefore be an area for the Environment Agency to explore. The Environment Agency may also need to consider if these exotic materials may have environmental impacts beyond their immediate use and therefore may have consequences for waste and pollution

 challenges however, particularly in identifying residents in apartment blocks who aren’t following the rules. All municipal institutions now use toilet roll that is produced from recycled milk and juice packaging. Zero-waste stores are appearing. The latter

 trend is similarly seen in hospitality with a rise in ‘Zero Waste’ restaurants. These establishments aim to avoid not just food leftovers, but any waste. Initiatives include set menus to avoid portion waste, onsite composting and customer ‘take away’, reclaimed,

 recycled and biodegradable decor and providing suppliers with reusable containers. Zero waste doesn’t mean zero impact - for example it is still a challenge to find ecological cleaning products. However it is expected that growing awareness of sustainability

A study has compared the brainwaves of patients that responded well to a drug called sertraline,

 compared to those that didn’t, and used an AI algorithm to look for patterns to help identify those that would respond well to the medicine. Typically the drug sertraline is only effective for around 33% of patients, however in this study 75% of those identified

 as having the brainwave pattern most likely to respond well found the medicine beneficial. Although only a small study, if such algorithms prove successful it could change the use of pharmaceuticals drastically. If data on other illnesses could provide intelligence

 on the best medicines to use on an individual level, we could see much more precise and targeted treatment.

 energy from ionising radiation, utilising pigments to convert gamma radiation into chemical energy. Although the research focuses on space travel and reducing restrictions for up-mass for missions to Mars in future, meaning the transportation of materials

 structures that may enable humans to explore underwater or outer space. The significant environmental benefits are that these aged snot palaces, when they are abandoned, contribute to ocean’s role as carbon sinks and furthermore take microplastics out of the

 water column, discarding them permanently on the sea floor. These skillful builders, who are humans’ closest relatives with no backbone, construct complex but fragile mucous structures ten times their height - the equivalent of a person making a five-story

 house, every day, all with snot coming out of their heads. The snot mansions both protect larvaceans from predators and provide their food by capturing the floating morsels by funnelling and filtering it straight into their mouths. When the mucus filters in

 these structures become clogged with particles, they are released to the sea floor where they become a food source to bottom dwellers such as sea cucumbers with all the dead organic matter collected as they are sinking slowly down. They also transport plastic

 pollution when entangled in the mucus structures and sequester millions of tons of carbon to the depths, in the process mitigating climate change. Researchers and NASA engineers are fascinated by the structures and want to study them to advance designing more

 Chitin is obtained commercially as a seasonal byproduct of the fishing industry, which means its production is currently restricted to coastal areas. There are also greenhouse gas emissions associated with shipping and transportation, alongside potential questions

 over sustainability of marine extraction. Chitin has previously been cited as a potential sustainable alternative to single use plastic (%2314240). The researchers envisaged a different approach to chitin production, involving Hermetia illucens black soldier

 flies fed on urban waste. Black soldier flies are already being harvested in this manner in the UK for use as food on fish farms. But in this study the researchers successfully extracted chitin from black soldier fly shells using limited energy. Their method

 doesn’t rely specifically on black soldier flies - chitin is present in a myriad of organisms in every ecosystem on earth. This means that their process could be applied in multiple situations, leading to bio inspired manufacturing and urban waste bio conversion,

This proposal could provide key evidence for the UK’s long-term national policy decisions towards zero

 carbon and hydrogen’s role in this energy transition. The Aberdeen vision project and H100 Fife are part of the Gas Goes Green initiative that aims to demonstrate the viability of hydrogen for heat purposes, including this Surf 'n' Turf project on Orkney if

 the regulator Ofgem approves the plan. The planned hydrogen production and storage system with connected heating network would run alongside the existing natural gas grid network, which could enable a large scale use of hydrogen in the future, thus providing

 a safe, cost-effective and reliable (with minimal disruption for customers) zero carbon energy source. Electrolysis means a process where tidal or wind energy is used to split water and make hydrogen, and it was first used in Orkney in 2017 for hydrogen production

 by the European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC). Hydrogen provides a practical zero carbon solution as it can be stored, transferred in special containers and shipped to a facility where it is converted back to electricity. SGN (Scotia Gas Networks) proposes to

 build a 100% zero-carbon hydrogen network in where hydrogen can be generated via an electrolysis plant in Eday powered by the offshore wind turbine, then stored before transfer in specially designed hydrogen storage trailers for shipment to Kirkwall; to include

14921,05/06/2020,Liisa Tang,Models used to form environmental sustainability and climate change policies suggest expansion of agricultural land requiring irrigation,"New research indicates that the future impacts of agricultural irrigation on environment and other sectors have been underestimated in previous models, and the real figure for 2050 could be far higher than previously projected, leading to a massive strain

 on aquifers and ecosystems. Existing models, with estimated population growth and food security demands, are used for policy making and therefore policymakers now should reconsider their policies for water and agriculture in order to avoid underestimating

 potential environmental costs. This new study, in collaboration between Princeton University in the USA, the University of Reading in the UK, and the University of Bergen in Norway, reminds us of the large amounts of water used for irrigation globally; about

 70% of freshwater withdrawals which, unlike water for residential and industrial uses, does not eventually return to the aquifer. Evaporation, evapotranspiration from plants, and leaky pipework can remove the irrigation water from the water cycle. Hence potential

 future expansion in irrigated agricultural land, to provide food for increasing population, together with increased drought due to climate change, would have consequences for water resources and intensely impact environment, and also require the use of land

 areas that are currently not cultivated. Needing more water for irrigation clearly suggests there would be reduced water supply for other sectors and hence increased stress on water resources. Vaster irrigated areas may lead to spreading agricultural use to

 non-cultivated areas which immediately reduces biodiversity. However, in light of the rapid change towards rewilding schemes, potentially there may be a decrease in agricultural land in England in the future. Many English farmers have their own reservoirs

 but these are intended to cope with only one irrigation season, hence the lack of water resources such as falling river flows is also a threat to the irrigated agriculture and domestic vegetable and fruit production in England, especially in South East. More

 irrigated areas may result in numerous potential impacts such as releasing more greenhouse gases because of irrigation machinery production and operation; increased energy such as fossil fuel use due to this machinery; reduced agricultural gas emissions; altering

 soil surface temperatures and increasing water vapour into the atmosphere; increased nitrates leaching to groundwater and hence limiting drinking water resources.

 dust that are key factors in how the climate system works; fine dust that scatters easily, and coarse dust (diameter, ≥5 μm) which impacts atmosphere in a similar way as greenhouse gases, warming up it up. UCLA atmospheric and ocean scientists argue, based

 on the measurements and calculations used, that current widely used atmospheric model simulations are dramatically different from what their results indicated. When multiplying the actual amount of coarse dust in the modelling simulations four fold, to about

 17 million metric tons instead of only 4 million metric tons, it increases the probability of both types of dust warming Earth’s climate system. The researchers report that this includes everything from clouds and rainfall to weather patterns, air to oceans,

The UCL researchers see the role of moths as

 complementary to the more selective daytime pollinators; a kind of critical back-up pollination service, to ensure semi-agricultural environments have a diverse wild plant population. Whereas bumblebees and honeybees target the most abundant sources of nectar

 and pollen, anything goes with the moths who visit any flower that they can access including brambles, legumes and clovers; all those flowers passed by other pollinating insects such as bees, butterflies and hoverflies. Supporting our widely diverse moth populations

 also helps the bats and birds that feed on them, for example cuckoos rely on moths as their critical food supply. Moths have been in decline since the 70s because of increasing intensive farming and related use of pesticides. Not only is more research required

 on the unique role of moths as pollinators and in how they support crop yields, but the public perception of moths needs to become more positive. Moth conservation is recommended to be integrated into modern agricultural management to stop the decline of moth

 populations urgently, as otherwise there are likely to be concerning consequences for our pollinator and plant interactions in agro-ecosystems which are complicated and inadequately studied.",https&%2358;//www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-05/ucl-mha051120.php ,Moths have a secret but vital role as pollinators in the night,EurekAlert!,12/05/2020,,"<p><a href=""https&%2358;//royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2019.0877"">Nocturnal pollinators strongly contribute to pollen transport of wild flowers in an agricultural landscape - Royal Society 13/05/2020</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//ec.europa.eu/environment/integration/research/newsalert/pdf/issue-23-2020-05-pollinators-future-brief__en.pdf"">Pollinators&%2358; importance for nature and human well-being, drivers of decline and the need for monitoring - European Commission 25/05/2020</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-52630991"">Nature crisis&%2358; Moths have 'secret role' as crucial pollinators - BBC 13/05/2020</a></p>",Error - action required,,,Error - action required,,DFOS,2 - near to realisation,DFOS,"agriculture, agro-ecosystem, pollination, moths, biodiversity, “agricultural practices”, legumes, clovers, Lepidoptera, “ecosystem services”, crops, “plant-pollinator relationship”, “ecological network”",No,Yes,No,No,No,,"agriculture, agro-ecosystem, pollination, biodiversity,  “ecosystem services”, crops, “plant-pollinator relationship”, “ecological network”",,,,[],18/05/2022 11:45,"Loveday, Tim",17/05/2021 12:02,"Loveday, Tim",0,,"15,295",,,Liisa Tang
14917,03/06/2020,Liisa Tang,Increased temperatures due to climate change will impact the health and safety of outdoor workers,"With climate change, summers are getting hotter which means that outdoors workers such as harvest pickers and some of our staff are at exposure from excessive heat more frequently, and it is employers’ responsibility to provide workers with regular rest

 periods, shade and enough drinking water while doing outdoor work. In England at present, many seasonal agricultural workers are experienced and therefore familiar with the scope of the role, willing to start working day before dawn to avoid the midday heat;

 nevertheless, this American study encourages employers to prepare for future conditions as the outdoor working conditions will worsen. California has been the first state in the USA to introduce a heat illness and fatality prevention related Act in 2019, to

 enforce standards to protect workers from heat-related risks on the job. Currently only Washington and Minnesota, in addition to California, have heat stress workplace protection standards although high heat temperatures can and have led to workplace fatalities.

 With temperatures increase brought by the climate change, this study is concerned for the health and safety of around 2 million agricultural workers in the USA. They are likely to become increasingly vulnerable due to these working conditions and more likely

 to suffer from health risks associated with pickers such as heat stress, heat stroke and kidney problems. The study draws our attention to a projection which suggests that under 2 degree increase, heat waves will become five times more common; and the number

 be impairing the immune system and leading to reduced immune responses, with the end result that respiratory mortality is increased. Accordingly, increases in autumn temperature variations like those pointed to by modelled climate projections could amplify

 the impact of seasonal flu.

 at inactive massive sulfide deposits. But they describe only minor disruption in relation to the carbon sequestration processes of manganese nodule fields. All this matters because it points to a building evidence base around the potential environmental impacts

 born 2000-2001 (corresponding to ‘Generation Z’ %2313473) participated in a workshop to discuss their perceptions of their future working environment and associated health safety &amp; wellbeing (HSW) concerns. ‘Good’ work would be characterised by reliability in

 terms of knowing what work they will get, flexibility and freedom in how they work, and social interaction with ‘easy to get along with’ colleagues. Sufficient salary would still be important, but other aspects would be equally or more important, including&%2358;

 enjoyable work; work/life balance; job security with an employer (or employers) who will enable them to gain experience; minimising travelling to permit time with family; and options to work from home. Essential future skills would include communication and

 friendliness, and IT skills including programming skills, as a lot of science involves modelling. Team working would also be important to increase productivity, relieve pressure and remove boredom and isolation. Not all tasks would be suited to home working.

 Views on team structures varied. Flat structures were preferred but thought to inhibit promotion prospects. Managers would preferably be interesting and approachable, involved and with a good sense of humour, who value their ideas and be knowledgeable. Occupational

 health risks of concern included slips, harm from other people, repetitive strain from inappropriate IT and air pollution. Overall many of the insights gleaned indicate that young workers concerns may not be that different to the concerns of current workers.

 However of particular note are uncertainties around pensions and not set end point to work, indicating that expectations and choice about retirement are changing. Continuing to ensure that these concerns are properly address could help the Environment Agency

 Berkeley. The overuse of antibiotics has led to an increasing AMR threat with human health and economic consequences, as it can make humanity more vulnerable in the future since we do not have an effective cure or treatment when “superbugs” appear. Correct

 antibiotic use can also reduce the quantity of pharmaceuticals in our water supply and hence alleviate concerns over water quality issues. The focus of this study was on children under the age of five. The researchers at the University of California, Berkeley,

 found out that two common vaccines - the pneumococcal conjugate and rotavirus vaccines - have a considerable impact on how many antibiotic treatments are required in childhood. Therefore these two vaccines can form a key global strategy in controlling resistance

 by protecting people from diseases such as meningitis, sepsis, tuberculosis (London) and pneumonia. Antibiotic resistance is a significant threat to health care systems with inappropriate use leading to the loss of drug-effectiveness, and in countries such

 as the UK it is common for children to be prescribed antibiotic treatment, even when it is clearly not needed, for example for ear infections and similarly for adults, for example for sinusitis. As combatting antimicrobial resistance is a priority for WHO,

 they created a global action plan on antimicrobial resistance, including antibiotic resistance, in 2015. With vaccination programmes globally, even without including effects from improving hygiene and sanitation, Berkeley researchers suggest that even with

 a careful estimate, approximately 40 million cases of antibiotic-treated illness could be prevented annually.",https&%2358;//www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200429133955.htm,"To prevent antimicrobial resistance, vaccinate the world's kids",Science Daily,29/04/2020,"Manke, Kara.","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200504155200.htm"">Intensive farming increases risk of epidemics - Science Daily 04/05/2020</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200427125213.htm"">Antibiotic exposure can 'prime' single-resistant bacteria to become multidrug-resistant - Science Daily 27/04/2020</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/04/antibiotic-treatment-covid-19-complications-could-fuel-resistant-bacteria%23"">Antibiotic treatment for COVID-19 complications could fuel resistant bacteria. - Science 16/04/2020</a></p><p><a href=""http&%2358;//www.technologynetworks.com/immunology/news/key-to-preventing-antimicrobial-resistance-is-vaccination-334209"">Key To Preventing Antimicrobial Resistance is Vaccination - Technology Networks 01/05/2020</a></p>",Error - action required,,,Error - action required,,DFOS,2 - near to realisation,DFOS,&quot;antimicrobial resistance&quot; AMR &quot;public health&quot; &quot;human health&quot; pathogens epidemiology infection ,No,Yes,No,No,No,,"""antimicrobial resistance"" AMR ""public health"" ""human health"" pathogens epidemiology infection ",,,,[],18/05/2022 11:45,"Loveday, Tim",17/05/2021 12:02,"Loveday, Tim",0,,"15,285",,,Liisa Tang

 Over 40 gigantic green houses in East Anglia are likely to require a large quantity of water which may have water quality and water resources implications in East Anglia, an Environment Agency Area familiar with low rainfall and prolonged dry weather. Each

 greenhouse is planned to be one-and-a-half times the size of the O2, or the size of 26 football pitches, for growing vegetables such as tomatoes, cucumbers and peppers. This is a “world-first” industry response to more people moving towards plant based diets

 and sustainable use utilising the land areas close to water recycling centres. The waste heat would be harvested from local water company Anglian Water owned recycling centres, using the largest heat pumps ever deployed in the UK; hence this renewable heat

 method is supported by the Government’s Renewable Heat Incentive. This project is at the forefront of contributing to the UK’s objectives of becoming carbon neutral, increasing the “clean heat” output and improving food security in a sustainable manner. The

 food miles associated with vegetables production could be reduced if the UK became more self-sufficient than previously, as Low Carbon Farming suggests that this template could be used nationwide. The first two of the UK’s largest greenhouses have already

 been built and they cover 70 acres; with potential to increase British tomato production by 12 percent. Anglian Water has indicated that they are working towards finding innovative solutions to the environmental challenges linked with heating local water courses.

 This project is presented as a neat co-operation opportunity for a food production company with a water company, supporting the low carbon and renewable heat initiatives. Nevertheless, in addition to potential problems with sufficient cooling to avoid heating

 the local water courses and an adverse impact on delicate ecosystems, consideration must be given to water abstraction issues.

14906,11/05/2020,Liisa Tang,A hybrid water supply system with potable reuse of municipal wastewater can efficiently ease pressure on water resources.,"A new type of modelling framework to assess the environmental and economic impacts of using a hybrid water supply system, with clean water and treated wastewater, has been developed by the researchers at Rice University in Houston, Texas. The hybrid model

 tested with real water and wastewater systems is critical for the UK due to our water resources shortage, as it could significantly improve water quality and water distribution within our limited water supply. This solution could reduce the pressure on demand

 from surface water sources such as reservoirs and rivers by 28%. The researchers at Brown School of Engineering, Rice University in Houston, Texas, compared the costs between bringing fresh surface water from a distance to urban centres and the cost of energy

 that is required to run innovative water treatment systems. The system, using City of Houston as a case study for data, indicates that fusing a central surface water resource with a supplementary recycled municipal wastewater can provide a solution to make

 water supply more resistant for future needs. The problem is that the technology required to achieve drinking water quality is currently expensive, hence the Rice University researchers have studied advanced water treatment and related technologies to find

 more cost-effective solutions at their Nanosystems Engineering Research Center for Nanotechnology-Enabled Water Treatment (NEWT). The research focussed on environmental and economic effects, using a cost-benefit analysis and considering trade-offs. The key

 factors in the model were the acquisition of potable water, energy required for treatment, transport costs, and in particular, how to transport without lowering the water quality. This study evaluated conflicting objectives to establish a balance between these

 factors. Naturally, the water quality is also easier to maintain the shorter the distance it needs to be moved is, minimising the risks of chemical, biological and pharmaceutical contaminants which is an essential feature in our historical pipe network. The

 researchers observed that as Houston has already got an existing dispersed wastewater treatment system and existing detention ponds throughout the city, they can store storm water to treat it for a non-potable use. It seems that the direct potable reuse of

 municipal wastewater could make it a worthwhile change towards advanced treatment technology systems. Treatment would be even cheaper for a newly established community, where the wastewater effluent could be minimally treated to make it suited for similar

 purposes as grey water, such as flushing toilets.",https&%2358;//phys.org/news/2020-04-recycling-slash-cities-fresh-resources.html,Model shows recycling could dramatically slash cities' need for fresh water resources,Error - action required,28/04/2020,"Willliams, Mike","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//news.rice.edu/2020/04/27/rice-engineers-make-wastewater-drinkable-again/"">Rice engineers&%2358; Make wastewater drinkable again - Rice University 27/04/2020</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200427184132.htm"">Make wastewater drinkable again - Science Daily 27/04/2020</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.nature.com/articles/s41893-020-0518-5"">The importance of system configuration for distributed direct potable water reuse - Nature 27/04/2020</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//cfpub.epa.gov/si/si_public_record_report.cfm?Lab=NRMRL&amp;dirEntryId=349128"">Distributed Mixed Wastewater and Graywater Treatment for Urban Water Reuse - New source 16/06/2020</a></p>",Error - action required,,,Error - action required,,DFOS,2 - near to realisation,DFOS,"wastewater, &quot;water resources&quot;, &quot;drinking water&quot;, treatment, engineering",No,Yes,No,No,No,,"wastewater, ""water resources"", ""drinking water"", treatment, engineering",,,,[],18/05/2022 11:45,"Loveday, Tim",17/05/2021 12:02,"Loveday, Tim",0,,"15,283",,,Liisa Tang

 exemplify these developments (%2315208). It also links into the UK Government’s Industrial Strategy. The recently devised Davos Manifesto sets out the role of company within this context. There are three main parts to the Manifesto, summarised below. A - a company’s

 purpose is to engage all its stakeholders in shared and sustained value creation, serving not only its shareholders, but all its stakeholders – employees, customers, suppliers, local communities and society at large. The best way to achieve this is through

 a shared commitment to policies and decisions that strengthen the long-term prosperity of a company. B - a company is more than an economic unit generating wealth. It fulfils human and societal aspirations as part of the broader social system. Performance

 must be measured not only on the return to shareholders, but also on how it achieves its environmental, social and good governance objectives. Executive remuneration should reflect stakeholder responsibility. C - a company that has a multinational scope of

 activities not only serves all those stakeholders who are directly engaged, but acts itself as a stakeholder – together with governments and civil society – of our global future. Corporate global citizenship requires a company to harness its core competencies,

 its entrepreneurship, skills and relevant resources in collaborative efforts with other companies and stakeholders to improve the state of the world. The Manifesto steers companies away from profit is the sole motivator and links longer term growth and prosperity

 to serving societal and environmental good as well we shareholder responsibility. The Environment Agency is potentially well placed to echo these messages when engaging with industry to achieve its regulatory objectives, demonstrating the bigger picture of

 localised company activities.",https&%2358;//www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/12/davos-manifesto-2020-the-universal-purpose-of-a-company-in-the-fourth-industrial-revolution/,Davos Manifesto 2020&%2358; the universal purpose of a company in the Fourth Industrial Revolution,Error - action required,02/12/2019,"Schwab, K",&%23160;,Error - action required,,,Error - action required,,DFOS,1 - realised,DFOS,&quot;World Economic Forum&quot; WEF sustainability sustainable &quot;Fourth Industrial Revolution&quot; 4IR company shareholder stakeholder society government environment regulation Davos,No,Yes,No,No,No,,"industry, sustainability, regulation",,,,[],18/05/2022 11:45,"Loveday, Tim",17/05/2021 12:02,"Loveday, Tim",0,,"15,282",,,Jason Dinsdale
14904,06/05/2020,Jason Dinsdale,A new operation in Canada is seeking to extract ‘green hydrogen’ from Canadian oil sands.,"This process has several parallels with unconventional gas and oil extraction, aka fracking (hydraulic fracturing), and therefore may have regulatory implications for the Environment Agency if a similar process occurs on UK soil. The operation in question

 is located in Saskatchewan, on the Superb oil field, a layer of oil bearing sand 700 metres below the Earth’s surface. Underground burning, also known as fire flooding has been used previously to extract oil, with previously little interest in the hydrogen

 by product. This is changing as hydrogen becomes more significant as an alternative fuel. Instead of extraction, the oil is set on fire, creating a chemical reaction that produces carbon dioxide (CO2) and hydrogen. Compared to current hydrogen production methods

 it is both cleaner and more economical. Hydrogen from methane gas produces GHGs and electrolysis of water is currently expensive. There are still some technical challenges to overcome on the road to achieving zero carbon emissions in this manner. The long

 term plan is to introduce a membrane to the well which allows hydrogen gas to pass through and reach the surface, leaving CO2 trapped underground, effectively producing greenhouse gas free energy from fossil fuel. The membrane that will be used on the well

 is made of palladium alloys, but this has fragility and technical issues that need to be overcome. The market for hydrogen is growing, both as an energy storage medium and as an addition to conventional gas. A UK trial of grid injected hydrogen into Keele

 University’s gas grid is underway to assess the cost and practicalities of using hydrogen in this manner to reduce fossil fuel dependency. A successful roll out could pave the way for increasing demand for hydrogen blending, which in turn may stimulate demand

 for home produced hydrogen. This in turn may create interest in using existing onshore oil and gas reserves to produce hydrogen in this way to contribute to climate change mitigation, which could require a regulatory response from the Environment Agency, amongst

 others.",https&%2358;//www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/02/company-harvest-green-hydrogen-underground-oil-fires%23,Company to harvest green hydrogen by igniting oil fires underground,Science,06/02/2020,"Hand, E","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.edie.net/news/8/UK-s-first-grid-injected-hydrogen-trials-begin-in-Staffordshire/?adfesuccess=1"">UK's first grid-injected hydrogen trials begin in Staffordshire - edie - Environmental Data Interactive Exchange 02/01/2020</a></p>",Error - action required,,,Error - action required,,DFOS,2 - near to realisation,DFOS,energy hydrogen &quot;climate change&quot; regulation &quot;fossil fuel&quot; oil gas Canada &quot;fire flooding&quot; underground combustion &quot;carbon dioxide&quot; syn gas membrane palladium Keele Staffordshire gas mix pipeline unconventional oils fracking &quot;hydraulic fracturing&quot;,No,Yes,No,No,No,,"energy, regulation, climate change",,,,[],18/05/2022 11:45,"Loveday, Tim",17/05/2021 12:02,"Loveday, Tim",0,,"15,281",,,Jason Dinsdale

Research in the United States looked at four substances known to impact child brain development&%2358;

 lead, mercury, pesticides, and flame retardants polybrominated diphenyl ethers. The study showed that between 2001 and 2016 lead cost US children 78 million IQ points, and mercury caused a loss of 2.5 million IQ points. Pesticides however caused a loss of

 nearly 27 million IQ points during those years, and flame retardants resulted in a loss of 162 million IQ points over the same period. The researchers conclude that just like lead and mercury that there is no ‘safe’ exposure level for pesticides and flame

 retardants. They have calculated that an individual IQ point is worth roughly 2 percent of a child's lifetime economic productivity. Based on this IQ loss due to lead, mercury, flame retardants, and pesticide exposure combined cost the US around US$6 trillion

 from 2001 to 2016. The research is US based, and may not directly translate to chemical use in the UK. However, further recognition of the connection between these chemicals and brain development could lead to the Environment Agency enforcing stricter regulations.

 in construction and asset management. In Mexico a giant 3D printer is on the way to creating a 3D printed village. A housing charity has partnered with a commercial company to provide a neighbourhood of affordable housing over a short timescale. Two houses

 can be printed in less than 24 hours, but human workers are still needed to provide roofs, fixtures and fittings. As this technology becomes more mainstream it could well find applications in flood defence construction, bringing with it cost savings. Elsewhere

 researchers have used a standard 3D printer to create a bullet-proof material. The polymer structure is based on a scaled up structure of tubulanes, theoretical structures of crosslinked carbon nanotubes predicted to have extraordinary strength. The macroscale

 blocks are full of holes, are highly compressible, yet can stop a bullet without sustaining much damage. Tubulane-like structures of metal, ceramic and polymer could lead to better materials for civil, aerospace, automotive, sports, packaging and biomedical

 applications. They could also find a use in oil and gas extraction due to their ability to stand impact, where standard materials become rubblised during hydraulic fracking. This durability could make the materials particularly problematic during waste recovery

 in the United States and is to some extent place specific, many of its assumptions could translate into other social and cultural contexts like the UK, although there may be differences. Ultimately though the research highlights the pressures a changing climate

 may put on everyday social and cultural arrangements, as well as questions of larger scale spatial and political arrangements, and points to the minutiae of life that may need to adapt. At a more direct level it could also be of concern to the Environment

14898,12/03/2020,Jason Dinsdale,The internet in its current form is unsustainable and could change dramatically as the World feels the effects of climate change and growing inequality.,"The Environment Agency like many organisations relies on the internet and other information technology to deliver its outcomes. Current arrangements may not be compatible with future resilience or aspirations for Net Zero. Writer Kevin Lozano describes

 the internet as “the biggest coal-fired machine on the planet”. Currently the internet consumes 10 per cent of global energy, which is still provided overwhelmingly from fossil fuels. As more people come online and more people utilise higher internet speeds

 (including 5G), stream more content, this is likely to grow. It is predicted that by 2030 the internet will account for between 20 and 50 per cent of global energy use, producing more carbon than any country other except China, USA and India. This figure will

 likely rise as more of the half of the global population still without internet access come online. Downloading a single web page can generate a significant quantity of carbon, particularly as websites become more dynamic and content rich compared to static,

 text based sites. Developments such as high definition video and 5G, cloud services, live streaming and virtual reality will all contribute to this. Aside from the energy demand impacts on climate change, much of the internet’s infrastructure is located in

 coastal areas potentially at risk from sea level rise. Climate change may also mean increased cooling costs for internet servers. More sunlight could mean more ultraviolet light which interferes with the electromagnetic frequency of Wifi. This could all contribute

 to more unreliable internet access. One of the challenges in reducing the internet’s footprint comes from its current business model. Advertising keeps a lot of internet access free, but adverts also account for a significant amount of energy. Streamlining

 websites would mean that the business model of the internet would have to change. This could mean access for only those who could afford it, driving inequalities in the digital world that climate change is also bringing to the physical world. This is already

 playing out in the difference of internet service between urban and rural areas. Individual behaviour could also go some way to reducing the internet’s impact. We have grown accustomed to posting and reposting content without considering the impact of web

 communication; this may have to change. The wealthier technology companies and their customers could conceivably isolate themselves for the impacts, less so smaller players and the less well off. It’s suggested that breaking Silicon Valley’s hold on the internet

 make it easier to impose environmental regulations on technology companies. Inequality can also be a catalyst for innovation.Moving to a more localised, decentralised internet could also be one solution towards sustainability. Communities may need to become

 more internet resilient in support of this, through building on small scale MESH networks (%2314052) for example. The Environment Agency and partners may need to consider firstly how to limit the impacts of its online activities, including the infrastructure

 and supply chain supporting it. Secondly it may be prudent how reliance on third party internet content and infrastructure may be impacted in the future, and what steps may need to be taken to offer contingencies, both in the short term to have resilience

 during incidents and in the longer term to ensure strategic resilience alongside Net Zero ambitions. Thirdly it may wish to consider how evolving developments in data storage such as DNA (%2314730, %2313922) and others may be adopted into business practices as

 lots of stuff, however these are digital rather than physical, embodying the notion of data citizens (%2315231). Some people are enjoying pod living so much that they are getting ‘Podestrian’ tattoos. In Japan the societal impacts of the urban sharing economy

It’s one of several systems in the earth’s climate thought to be vulnerable

 to climatic forcing, and that could represent a ‘tipping point’ in climate change. It involves the slowing or stopping of warm water currents that draw up energy from the equator. As freshwater is introduced into the North Atlantic from melting Arctic ice

 sheets it prevents the formation of denser saline waters that would normally sink, drawing warmer waters up and over them. The result for countries like the UK would be a significant reduction in climatic temperatures and amounts of rainfall. The authors suggests

 that this would also lead to widespread impacts on agricultural production, including an effective cessation of arable farming and a reduction in productivity an order of magnitude higher than those already anticipated under climate change scenarios. The implications

 are clearly severe for the EA and wider UK society as a whole. A key driver of the declines are likely to be reductions in precipitation and water availability, implying increased levels of demand for dwindling freshwater resources. Food prices may also rise

14893,06/03/2020,sbrown,New theoretical insights in the field of Ecological Economics could help to shed light on why environmental governance regimes like that of the Environment Agency might ultimately fail.,"The investigation tracked water resource policies in 6 European countries over a period of 254 years, mapping out their developing integration and extent. It identified a tendency for contradictions in institutional policies, particularly at the interface

 of public policy and property rights, to develop as the regimes evolved over time. Those ‘mis-complementarities’ occurred both within institutions and between them, and eventually resulted in a lack of coherence at the policy regime level. This effect was

The findings indicate that artificially enhancing the levels of Sestrin

 in a subset of the population mimicked the benefits of exercise – i.e. their physical performance was improved without any induced activity. The results imply that controlling levels of Sestrin in humans might result in health improvements. The logical next

 step therefore is to see if these effects are replicable in a human population. If they are then groups currently unable to exercise, such as older people, those with physical injuries and those with limiting social commitments, could gain access to its benefits.

 While these lines of enquiry are at an early stage and modes of delivery for any supplement are still unclear, a plausible direct implication for the environment agency of an oral pathway might be an increased level of Sestrin in waste water. There are also

While it’s common knowledge that SO4 occurrence in the atmosphere is related to the presence of SO2, the complex processes of oxidation that mediate and enable the transformation

 have, until now, not been well understood. Data generated as part of a collaborative project between U.S. and Chinese researchers are beginning to shed light on this gap in our understanding. They demonstrate that concentrations of NOx play a key role in smog

 formation, and that broadly they enable three pathways through which smog formation can take place. When NOx concentrations are low, NOx catalyses the production of hydroxyl radicals - effective oxidants of SO2 - and thus promote the formation of sulfate.

 When NOx concentrations are extremely high, as is common in fog-haze conditions, NOx are the dominant oxidants of SO2 and thus also promote formation of sulfate. But, importantly, when NOx concentrations are at a medium level they act as a sink for hydroxyl

 radicals and, counterintuitively, supress sulfate formation. That means that in order to control smog formation the management of relative levels of NOx and S02 in the atmosphere is key. This could be a potentially useful insight for members of the EA tasked

Accordingly

 ‘seeing’ the influence of climate change in a daily weather observation has been extremely problematic. But researchers in Switzerland and Norway have developed a technique that averages spatial differences in global climatic parameters at a given point in

 time to generate a metric (global mean average temperature) that makes it possible to track shifts in the global climate on a daily basis. They’ve discovered that when the spatial variations in global temperatures are averaged out they provide a reliable and

 consistent average temperature with a relatively narrow range of variability. Accordingly daily changes in that global average temperature can be used to track global climatic changes. Characteristic spatial patterns in the anomalous daily data can then be

 then generated via regression modelling to identify the ‘fingerprint’ of climatic change as it applies to different regions of the globe. This means that in situ daily weather observations can be compared against the fingerprint to discern the influence of

 climatic forcing on particular events in particular places. The upshot is that specific weather events can be attributed to climate change in a statistically meaningful way. All this could have considerable consequences for our ability to communicate the risks

That matters because the EA’s objective of achieving net zero requires it to consider levels

 of embedded carbon in goods and materials, to which the operation of global supply chains is a significant contributor.

 Those concerns were subsequently borne out by a decrease in the Global Connectedness Index score for that year. Analysis of the shifts underpinning the decline suggest that it’s principally being driven by a contraction in the flows of capital across borders,

 particularly in connection with changes to the U.S. tax system. But data also shows that global trade flows began to contract in the first half of 2019, potentially pointing to a longer term effect. Other metrics considered by the index, such as flows of people

 In around 15 days, compared to 3200 years for SF6. It decomposes into CO2 which remains in the atmosphere and other molecules which are washed out. Another alternative is “Green Gas for Grid”—or “g³” (pronounced “g- cubed”) developed by GE. g3 gas has a mass

An increasing focus on ‘Net Zero’ and other environmental issues could mean that sustainable alternatives to conventional construction materials

 may need to be adopted and developed. Previously engineers took inspiration from nature to try and mimic properties such as materials that self heal on contact with the air. Today’s research is focusing more on incorporating biological functions into building

 materials. Researchers in the USA have been experimenting with bacteria to develop building materials that live, multiply and grow. Under the right conditions cyanobacteria can absorb carbon dioxide from the air, creating calcium carbonate along the way. The

 researchers have been considering how these properties could be turned to making living buildings that can grow and repair themselves, involving a fraction of the resource and carbon footprint equivalent of conventional buildings. In the current experiments

 cyanobacteria are added to a sand and gelatin solution. The calcium carbonate that the bacteria mineralises the gelatin and binds the sand together to make a brick. It’s also possible to chop the brick in half, only for the bacteria to regrow it, suggesting

 self repairing properties. In the future dessicated raw materials could be sent to a construction site, where workers simply add water to grow and shape microbial components or even entire structures. Elsewhere researchers are looking at self healing construction

 materials inspired by plant photosynthesis. Self healing is one aspect of this, as is the idea of self aware living constructions that can change themselves in response to seasonal changes. Questions remain around safety and stability of living structures,

 and also how humans and other living organisms would react to living structures. There may be environmental concerns around pollution or biosecurity. However the potential environmental benefits may make this approach attractive when compared to the carbon

 dioxide (CO2) emissions and sand extraction related to contemporary concrete production, for example. There are also waste management benefits. Rather than creating rubble for landfill living structures, such as bridges made of strong plant fibre could simply

Of particular interest is also how machines reach decisions

 compared to their human counterparts, and whether these are acceptable, as well as correct. AI and machine learning is being used to translate languages already. This is based on analysis of word relationships - no matter how complicated a language there are

 always relationships between how words are used in relation to the context. Theoretically non-human communication should obey similar rules, for example whale song is already known to be formed from recurring patterns. AI may be able to unlock these ‘rules’

 allowing us to understand and communicate with animals that show some level of intelligence and awareness, including our pet cats and dogs. The normalisation of robots in domestic settings is evident in Japan, where machines are already replacing organic pets.

 Owners are reportedly taking their robotic pets on playdates, just as they would their living counterparts. Sony’s dog like Aibo is the pet of choice&%2358; their personality changing and expanding as it increasingly interacts with its surroundings. Future versions

 realistic nature of its appearance and behaviour, plus its ‘programmability’ have already seen therapeutic applications alongside an increase in orders for countries affected by wildlife trade bans and coronavirus. While voice activated assistants are becoming

 commonplace, physical ‘companion’ robots have yet to be widely accepted, though events such as this demonstrate that this may also be changing. Another example is news that one of the acts announced to perform at the Coachella Festival 2020 is Hatsune Miku,

This discovery offers the opportunity to develop a process that can use any inexpensive carbon source, such as waste, to produce graphene flakes using only flash joule heating. Graphene

 made this way is named flash graphene (FG). Although any source of carbon can be used to make FG, the higher the carbon content of the base material, the higher the quality and quantity of FG produced. The researchers designed a bespoke reactor to undertake

 the transformation process, so that waste gasses such as oxygen and nitrogen can be captured for economic use. The reaction wastes little heat as the majority is channelled into the carbon material to facilitate the reaction. The researchers believe that incorporating

Fairbourne in the county of Gwynedd looks set to be ‘decommissioned’ by the local council due to the costs of defending it from rising sea levels and associated

 flood events, as well as surface water and fluvial flooding. In 25 years or sooner the council plan to have all residents relocated. As a result of this strategy becoming public, house prices in the village have collapsed, meaning that the current residents

 have lost a source of capital needed to relocate. Properties are still selling for a reduced price to people looking to make money from rental. The long term fate of Fairbourne’s residents is uncertain. They won’t receive compensation for the forced move.

 The villagers have been dubbed Britain’s first climate refugees. However, the term ‘refugee’ currently has a specific legal meaning which also comes with certain legal rights, which wouldn’t apply to Fairbourne residents. As the impacts of climate change become

 more acutely felt, it is possible that more local authorities and other government agencies may take similar decisions due to sprially flood and coastal defence costs. This could have social, political, economic and legal ramifications for all actors in this

 space, including the Environment Agency. For example delaying abandonment due to short term political issues rather than following longer term strategic trajectories could lead to significant losses from maintaining obsolete defences and reduce residents longer

One consequence is that people are turning to online sales of antibiotics intended

 for fish to obtain an alternative to human pharmaceuticals. Analysis of online sales reviews indicated that 2.4 per cent of them indicated that the antibiotics had been purchased with human consumption in mind. These reviews also received more attention and

 positive ‘likes’ than other reviews. There was also instances of retailers assuring that fish antibiotics were safe for human consumption. Fish antibiotics are cheaper than human ones, but they are not regulated to the same extent as other veterinary drugs,

 so there is no guarantee of content, risks of side effects or dose strength. There is at least one instance of someone becoming seriously ill from their consumption. While overall consumption is not high it may be difficult to quantify both volume and impact

 of sales, which is linked ultimately to rising costs and standards of living. In another example of ‘self administered healthcare a biohacker used knowledge and parts gleaned from the internet to ‘hack’ his insulin pump into an artificial pancreas. Frustration

 with healthcare professionals led to software engineer Liam Zebedee converting his pump into a system that automatically measures glucose levels in his blood and dispense insulin accordingly. Zebedee acknowledges the risks of relying on unproven software but

 still believes it safer and more value for money than professional healthcare.Economic stagnation combined with changing models of healthcare delivery in the UK could precipitate the circumstances where some people may similarly turn to alternative sources

 of medicine. This may impact on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in general, but may have specific impacts on the wild aquatic species to which it was intended originally. There are previous cases of the internet enabling use (%2314524 ) and potential manufacture

 (%2314582) of illegal or restricted chemicals, and there are also incidences of similar biohacks to reduce medical costs significantly (%2313874) . There is increasing evidence that medical professionals are increasingly using YouTube to review surgical procedures

14868,23/12/2019,Jason Dinsdale,The emerging field of bioacoustics could offer potential for environmental monitoring.,"The Environment Agency and partners may wish to consider how technological development and scientific understanding could unlock the potential of sound to enhance current environmental monitoring programmes. Bioacoustics is an emerging research field that

 usings audio recordings to enhance ecological and environmental understanding. The cost of photographical, video and audio recording devices has decreased significantly in recent years, contributing to the growing interest in this field. Old smartphones for

 example have previously been repurposed as intelligence gathering tools for use in combating illegal logging (%2312696). New purpose built devices such as AudioMoth are very cheap and light, and can record frequencies outside of human hearing. Some devices are

 small enough to be attached to a bird for recording purposes. Artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging that can identify species from recordings, which can otherwise be a time consuming task for humans. Audio recorders are in some ways better than cameras

 as they can cover a larger geographical area than the camera’s field of view. Recording the sounds within a habitat can identify the range of species present. If monitored over time these recordings can indicate changes in biodiversity and habitat, such as

 breeding patterns and spreads of disease and how factors such as climate, weather and human activity impact on biodiversity. As knowledge in this field advances it may be possible to use bioacoustics to infer a range of environmental monitoring criteria. In

 terms of more short term bioacoustic applications has recently been discovered for example that plants can make ultrasonic squeaks stressed by environmental conditions, including water shortage. The sounds are made when air bubbles inside xylem tubes used

 for water transport implode, known as cavitation. These sounds have been observed at distance for the first time in commercial greenhouse crops, and could possibly be detected by insects and animals, altering their behaviour. Moths may not lay eggs on water

 stressed plants for example.

Recently a US citizen was found guilty of targeting women with malware that recorded video footage

 intended to be used for blackmail. It’s observed that the perpetrator could equally have resided outside of the USA, which would’ve presented many logistical and political challenges in bringing them to justice, to the point where the is little appetite to

 do so. This in turn may embolden criminals to try this and other tactics. Outside of cyberspace, there are also signs that technology enabled violence is on the rise. One observer notes that the ‘K/K Ratio’ (ratio of killers to killed) is falling, meaning

 that more people are being killed by fewer killers. Professor Stuart Russell outlines a scenario a small team of people could threaten the lives of millions of people. A small drone (UAV) fitted with a charge as small as one gram would easily carry enough

 firepower to kill someone. Significant numbers of these could be purchased for very little cost and fit in a lorry. And unlike guns they would not need soldiers to operate them. They could be pre-programmed with facial recognition software to target individuals

 or groups of individuals and deployed in areas of high population concentration. Terrorists and criminals of the future may also have access to biotechnology, nanotechnology and artificial intelligence (AI) all of which facilitate the opportunities to operate

 across borders. The proposition of an onmiviolent future brings into question what purpose the state system has if is becoming increasingly ineffective at protecting its citizens. In terms of countermeasure one hypothesis could be to increase AI controlled

 surveillance, which would involve a significant curtailment of current liberties in turn for increased protection. This in itself may present opportunities for exploitation from criminals and state operators alike, but may still be preferred to the risk of

14863,13/12/2019,Jason Dinsdale,"Conventional farming, and livestock associated sectors in particular, could be about to undergo a radical transformation.","The climate emergency, human health and EU Exit are just some of the issues that create discussion on the future of UK agriculture. Scientists have recently stated that the World needs to reach ‘Peak Meat’ consumption by 2030 to cut emissions from meat and

 dairy and avoid the climate emergency. Think tank Common Wealth have proposed a Green New Deal to tackle these problems synergistically through allocating 25% of land to wildlife and carbon sequestration, alongside behavioural changes towards meat and dairy.

 Sir Ian recently clashed with the NFU over visions for the future of UK farming. Former Defra Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Ian Boyd sees Brexit as an opportunity for similar goals. The NFU sees the opposite occurring as the UK’s well-watered pastures are ideal

 for producing low-carbon livestock for export to less favourable territories. There is emerging evidence on the potential health risks of dairy produce. But as meatless alternatives hit the mainstream there are concerns that the processed nature of their manufacture

 may mean they are less than a healthy alternative. In a sense China’s ‘polar bear’ sized pig breeding can almost be seen as living metaphor of a system reaching its limits of scale and efficiency. These same tensions between environmental, economic and social

 concerns arrive at a time when the World could be on the cusp of the most significant technological disruption to agricultural production in 10,000 years&%2358; Food as Software  Rapid advances in precision biology is making huge strides in precision fermentation, allowing microorganisms to be ‘programmed’ to produce almost any complex organic molecule. In this system the cost of proteins will be five times cheaper by 2030 and 10

 times cheaper by 2035 than existing animal proteins, before ultimately approaching the cost of sugar. Product after product extracted from livestock will be replaced by superior, cheaper, modern alternatives, long before other technologies develop lab grown

 meat.  Food will be superior in every key attribute – more nutritious, healthier, better tasting, and more convenient, with almost unimaginable variety.   The impact of this disruption on conventional farming will be profound. By 2030, the number of cows in the U.S. will halve. The impacts on livestock farming, and related industries (fertilisers, machinery, veterinary services, etc.) will be severe, destroying

 billions of dollars of value. At the heart of the new production model is ‘Food-as-Software’. Individual molecules will be uploaded to databases for food engineers anywhere in the World to use use. Constant iteration means products improve rapidly, with each

 version superior and cheaper than the last. It also ensures a completely decentralised production system that is more resilient than conventional agriculture. Trade relations will shift because decentralized food production doesn’t offer geographic of climatic

 advantage. Major exporters of animal products will lose geopolitical leverage over countries dependent upon imports.  .  Disruption will not be uniform however. Some industries only require a small number of replacement ingredients to be completely disrupted, such as milk, where only 3.3 per cent of its content is protein. By 2035, about 60% of the land currently being used

 for livestock and feed production will be freed for other uses. Farmland values could collapse, providing an opportunity to reimagine and repurpose the whole landscape. ‘Food As Software’ could extend to diner’s needs and expectations. A Japanese restaurant

 concept uses personalised data extracted from bodily fluids to design sushi tailored to an individual’s nutritional needs. Customers would share their biometric information in advance in order for the automated process to create a hyper-personalised meal.  ‘Food As Software’ concept stimulates conversation on the scale, speed, and impact of the modern food disruption. In this sense the changes it proposes could bring significant operational and strategic challenge to the Environment Agency in terms of site

 base regulation of the farming and food sectors. It could also offer opportunities around influencing land use change to address some of the same strategic challenges around flood management and physical modification of rivers. It should also be noted that

 the suggested ‘tipping point’ for Peak Meat and the dawn of a Food as Software future is around 2030, within the scope of the 25 year Environment Plan.",https&%2358;//www.rethinkx.com/food-and-agriculture,"We are on the cusp of the fastest, deepest, most consequential disruption of agriculture in history",RethinkX,13/12/2019,,"<p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.dezeen.com/2019/04/02/sushi-singularity-3d-printed-sushi-customised/"">Sushi Singularity makes a bespoke dinner based on your bodily fluids - Dezeen 02/04/2019</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/10/7/20880318/meatless-meat-mainstream-backlash-impossible-burger"">Meatless meat is becoming mainstream - and it's sparking a backlash - Vox 07/10/2019</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/12/peak-meat-climate-crisis-livestock-meat-dairy"">Reach `peak meat' by 2030 to tackle climate crisis, say scientists - The Guardian 12/12/2019</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//common-wealth.co.uk/gnd-for-nature.html"">Green New Deal for Nature - Common Wealth 11/09/2019</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.thesun.co.uk/news/10182843/cheese-increases-prostate-cancer-risk/"">UN-BRIE-LIEVABLE Eating cheese `increases your risk of prostate cancer' - The Sun 21/10/2019</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-50092540"">Climate policies 'will transform UK landscape' - BBC 01/11/2019</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-06/china-is-breeding-giant-pigs-the-size-of-polar-bears"">China's breeding giant pigs that are as heavy as polar bears - Bloomberg 06/10/2019</a></p>",Error - action required,,,Error - action required,,DFOS,4 - signficant development needed,DFOS,farming food agriculture meat livestock protein &quot;food as software&quot; regulation land use crops milk pasture microorganism wildlife &quot;EU Exit&quot; Brexit China pig &quot;polar bear&quot; &quot;Sir Ian Boyd&quot; NFU national farmers union USA ReThinkX 2030 2035 fermentation bacteria software development nutrition diet population data sushi rewilding research internet ,No,Yes,No,No,No,,"farming, regulation, land use",,,,[],18/05/2022 11:45,"Loveday, Tim",17/05/2021 12:01,"Loveday, Tim",0,,"15,240",,,Jason Dinsdale

 significantly increased through replacing the graphite cathode with an organic, nanostructured cathode, made of the carbon-based molecule anthraquinone. Anthraquinone enables higher energy density through storing positive charge-carriers from the battery’s

 electrolyte solution. The aluminium battery is still a concept, but the breakthrough suggests huge potential. There are already plentiful quantities of aluminium in the system, as well as the infrastructure to recycle it safely, which should mean that battery

The Super Heavy is constructed from 301 stainless steel with a nominal composition

 of 17 percent chromium and 7 percent nickel. Using steel as opposed to carbon fibre reduces the costs of a 120 tonne rocket from $15.6 million to £300,000, whilst also greatly reducing labour costs and construction time. The reductions in cost, build time

 and turnaround of these renewable rockets could translate into significant changes in both freight and passenger transport. The current payload is able to put 300 tonnes into orbit per year. A fleet of 20 Super Heavy rockets flying three times a day could

 increase this to 3 million tonnes a year. It would be possible to deliver a package anywhere on Earth in around an hour (providing the correct infrastructure was in place). Musk has also discussed how Super Heavies could be used for passenger transport. A

 Super Heavy could transport up to 1000 passengers at a time, paying between $500 - $2000, comparable to current long haul flights. The difference is that a Super Heavy would reduce intercontinental travel time from hours down to minutes. The potential disruption

 that technology like the Super Heavy could bring is significant. Details on fuel and emissions suggest that the Super Heavy will burn cryogenic liquid oxygen (LOX) and liquid methane propellants, which may need regulatory regimes, alongside concerns around

 emissions. A transition to this form of transport may present competition to the airline industry, decreasing emissions from an Environment Agency regulated sector. At a time where limiting container ship speeds is being considered as a means to reduce air

The analysis indicates that reduced neural excitation

 is related to a longer life span and that there is a dynamic relationship between how long people live and the excitatory – inhibitory balance of neural circuits. Levels of neural excitation are regulated by genes. When the expression of those genes was manipulated

 experimentally in worms, researchers found they could extend their lifespan. The suggestion is that this could be a step towards similar gene therapy treatments in humans with the potential to slow the aging process and extend the length of time people live

14854,15/11/2019,sbrown,"As new data focused digital communication technologies become incorporated into our everyday lives, the relationship between what it means to be a citizen, the rights we have, and how we participate in the economy is being re-moulded.","An investigation into the long term cultural and political evolution of what it means to be a citizen and a consumer in a western capitalist economy has sketched out the emergence of a new state of being for many of us – the ‘data citizen’. The work starts

 with an examination of how our role as traditional ‘consumers’ was originally constructed and has changed over time. Consumers, as we understand them today, first began to emerge in the United States during the early 20th century as people’s rights

 as citizens became linked to their ability to participate in the economy – the beginning of the notion that ‘freedoms’ could be bought through spending. These new circumstances were particularly important for women at a time before they could vote. The power

 to consume provided a pathway to greater levels of independence when many other avenues were still closed. These new arrangements soon brought about the development of entirely new professions, such as marketing and industrial design, that further evolved

 and consolidated the link between consumption and how people were able to participate in society. During this period spending money became akin to voting as an expression of preferences, and consumption took on the political character that is familiar to us

 today. The ‘citizen – consumer’ was born.   But in the last 10 – 15 years the inter-relationship of spending, cultural rights and freedoms has started to change. The appearance of the digital ‘data economy’ has begun to give new meaning to what it means to be a consumer and to consume. Instead of

 simply spending and receiving a stream of ‘stuff’, new ‘data citizens’ are now actively generating value in the economy through the digital footprint they leave behind. In the very same moment they are very often empowered as the producers and distributers

 of their content. So in this new digital sphere rights, freedoms and services are made available not according to an individual’s ability to buy ‘things’ but according to their willingness and ability to participate in the digital world and exchange information

 about themselves for access. Counter-intuitively this has ended up eroding rights like privacy and the control and ownership of personal data, which traditional consumers have come to expect. Consequently it’s also changed the political nature of consumption,

 shifting power away from consumers to providers. When a consumer’s data is used to develop and inform algorithms they’re in effect transformed into little more than the ‘node’ of a massive neural data network built to target them with new tailored advertising

 and services. As these new arrangements become more ‘normal’ and expected so the role of the consumer is morphing into one of simply being a ‘sensory organ’ for a huge Artificial Intelligence and data collecting operation – the ‘data citizen’ is born.  So what’s new here is that our understanding and expectations of what it is to be a consumer – the role we all play – as well as the power relationships around it, are changing to incorporate the digital sphere. That in turn has really important implications

 for the types of services we use, the reasons we use them and what doing so means to us – the digital era is changing not only how we buy stuff, but what we buy, why and what for.   The significance of this to the Environment Agency is clear&%2358; What might be the ramifications of these new types of consumers – empowered to produce, but, stripped of important other rights – be for the way material goods are produced distributed, used and

 disposed of? Will, or to what extent, will material based modes of consumption be displaced or encouraged? How will the EA sit in a world where consumption and demand are more fully shaped by algorithms and their data models? How could the EA position itself

Resveratol is a compound

 found in grape skin and blueberries. It also reportedly also found in high concentrations in varieties of knotweed. It’s been previously investigated for its anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and anti-diabetic effects. Knotweed is already known to be edible,

 which has suggested one pathway to controlling it (%2314115 ) Its properties as a treatment against muscle and bone wasting are being investigated to protect astronauts from the rigours of zero-gravity and long space flights. Closer to home resveratol reputedly

 derived from giant knotweed and japanese knotweed is being marketed and sold as a dietary supplement - though the provenance of these products may be in question.. David Sinclair, professor of genetics at Harvard has spent his career studying age related diseases.

 He is focussed on finding a drug to slow these processes and possibly reverse them in the longer term. Sinclair has studied resveratol’s effects on mice. However issues with maintaining high resveratol levels in the bloodstream, coupled with the inability

 to patent resveratol as it’s a natural substance are highlighted as reasons for pursuing other lines of interest. But Sinclair himself takes resveratol supplements, as does his father who is in his 70s. Both giant and japanese knotweed are identified as problematic

 invasive plants, with the latter seen are more problematic. Of further interest is acknowledgement that hybrids of the two plants exhibits hybrid vigour and is reputed to be more invasive than the parents as it has a more varied genome. Commercialised farming

 of giant knotweed could lead to more widespread hybridisation and therefore more problematic plants in the wild, without appropriate biosecurity precautions. Currently problems associated with japanese knotweed cost the UK economy in the region of £165 million

 per year.

14850,21/10/2019,Jason Dinsdale,The environmental impact of military activities may becoming under increasing scrutiny.,"Several examples coming to light suggest this. The US Military (%2312637, %2314134) (amongst others (%2312065) including the UK (%2312974)) have previously highlighted a potential link between continued climate change and increasing civil unrest. It is therefore

 perhaps significant to note recent research that reveals the extent of the US Military’s carbon footprint. The study in question suggests that the US military is one of the largest polluters in history. It consumes more fuel and emits more greenhouse gases

 (GHGs) than most medium sized countries. Were it a country, its fuel usage would rank it the 47th largest GHG emitter, between Peru and Portugal. Closer to home recent evidence has established a link between the UK civilian nuclear programme and the nuclear

 defence industry. Energy bills are being inflated in order to subsidise civilian nuclear power, which in turn cross subsidises defence activities such as nuclear submarines through underpinning the relevant supply chain and skills base for firms that work

 on nuclear submarines. It is claimed that this interdependence, rather than a need for a diverse energy mix, that is partially preventing further financial support and development of renewable energy sources. Current political tensions are seeing rising numbers

 of ballistic missiles, both conventional and nuclear globally, which may mean that the UK is reluctant to reduce its nuclear capability in the short term, further preventing further advancement of renewable energy development. The impact of military operations

 on biodiversity has also recently been raised by a group of prominent scientists who are pressing for environmental damage to be recognised as a war crime. The scientists suggest that international lawmakers should adopt a fifth Geneva convention that recognises

 damage to nature alongside other war crimes. This would safeguard threatened species, and support the livelihoods of rural communities, both during and post-conflict. How these collective signals influence the role of domestic environmental regulators is unclear.

 However a movement for a greater global accountability for the impact of military operations on the environment could lead to changes in some current activities such as regulation of carbon emissions from civilian aviation to also include defence aircraft

 in accounting.",https&%2358;//www.theguardian.com/law/2019/jul/24/make-environmental-damage-a-war-say-scientists-geneva-convention,"Make environmental damage a war crime, say scientists",The Guardian,24/07/2019,"Watts, J","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//theconversation.com/us-military-is-a-bigger-polluter-than-as-many-as-140-countries-shrinking-this-war-machine-is-a-must-119269"">US military is a bigger polluter than as many as 140 countries - shrinking this war machine is a must - The Conversation 24/06/2019</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-48509942"">Nuclear&%2358; Energy bills 'used to subsidise submarines' - BBC 05/06/2019</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//qz.com/1637386/the-trump-era-has-brought-the-world-a-new-missile-arms-race/"">The world is heading for a new missile arms race - Quartz 09/06/2019</a></p>",Error - action required,,,Error - action required,,DFOS,1 - realised,DFOS,&quot;climate change&quot; defence military army US &quot;greenhouse gas&quot; GHG fuel oil &quot;fossil fuel&quot; &quot;civil unrest&quot; energy carbon nuclear renewable missile weapon missile consumer cost subsidies law regulation crime biodiversity UN,No,Yes,No,No,No,,"defence, climate change, biodiversity",,,,[],18/05/2022 11:45,"Loveday, Tim",17/05/2021 12:01,"Loveday, Tim",0,,"15,227",,,Jason Dinsdale

 structure consisting of metal ions and polyphenols. These membrane performed well in a range of factors including selectivity, capacity and renewability both in the lab and during field-testing. These results demonstrate that MPN-based membranes show promise

 in scaling up for economically productive real-world uranium extraction. Technology like this alongside other similar approaches (%2314835) could lead to more plentiful supplies of uranium, which in turn may mean more nuclear power. The Environment Agency’s

 to tap water contaminants is approximately 4 × 10−4, which is two orders of magnitude higher than the minimal cancer risk of one-in-a-million, and comparable to risks reported for air pollutants. The study concludes that decreasing current pollution levels

14842,04/10/2019,Jason Dinsdale,Recent research has highlighted the social and environmental impacts of the data and training behind artificial intelligence (AI).,"As the debate around the ethics of AI systems grows the Environment Agency may wish to consider their position on this issue from an environmental as well as ethical perspective. AI systems and machine learning rely on training systems based on large data

 sets. Some of the learning happens automatically, but there are also aspects of this that require human intervention to train the machine. Some of this work is fulfilled by microworkers - people who complete repetitive tasks that machines alone cannot do.

 Tasks can include drawing boxes around features in video footage of roads to teach driverless cars what a trees or other obstacles look like, or tagging content with feelings such as “sad” songs or “worrying” text. The work is not particularly well paid, but

 people freely partake it in. Amazon is thought to employ up to 2500 microworkers at a time through its ‘Mechanical Turk’ market place each month. Average microworker wage in Europe is around $3 - approximately £2.44. The current UK living wage is £9 per hour.

 The environmental cost of Al training has recently been calculated. It is believed that training a single AI can emit the same carbon footprint as five cars, including manufacture. The in research that look specifically at natural language processing (NLP)

 training such a system emitted more than 626,000 pounds of carbon dioxide equivalent. Training AI is computationally expensive and energy intensive. As AI grows in sophistication so will its resource footprint (assuming all other factors stay the same). The

14841,03/10/2019,Jason Dinsdale,Autonomous vehicles may become a feature of marine as well as terrestrial transport.,"This development could be of interest to the Environment Agency’s work, due to the potential to reduce greenhouse gas and other emissions from sea freight transport, which has been shown previously to impact negatively on air quality in coastal regions (%2313624).

 Human error is also a significant factor in maritime accidents&%2358; autonomous shipping could therefore reduce the potential for ocean pollution incidents. However there is also a possibility that an autonomous ship could become a target of cybercrime for piracy

 or to be used as a means to damage coastal settlements and defences. According to Allianz insurers between 75% and 96% of maritime accidents are caused by human error. Autonomous ships could help to reduce this number significantly through machine learning

 and data analysis, which could be used to inform and assist human crew to counteract factors such as fatigue and human error. Autonomous ships may also be able to reduce staff costs making shipping cheaper. Environmental savings could complement cost savings

 through fuel reductions - combined with workforce savings this could amount to over $7 million over 25 years per autonomous vessel (assuming this depends on vehicle size). There are several technical hurdles to overcome to ensure safety, meaning that fully

 autonomous ships may still become realised widely some time in the future. Some companies are building fully autonomous ships from scratch, while other start-ups are developing semi-autonomous systems to be used on existing vessels. There are already examples

 where fully autonomous ships have been trialled. The Norwegian Maritime Authority (NMA) recently tested the outcome of the ROMAS (Remote Operation of Machinery and Automation Systems) project. The aim was to move the engine control room (ECR) from the ship

 to a shore-based engine control centre (ECC), where personnel could operate a single ship, or a fleet of vessels, remotely. In a test a ferry was operated remotely on the 35-minute between Molde and Vestnes. Note that this is not strictly an autonomous operation.

 However an autonomous marine vessel recently carried an oyster shipment between the UK and Belgium. The USV Maxlimer, developed by SEA-KIT International Ltd made the 22-hour journey from Essex to Ostend. The vessel deployed GPS positioning and satellite communication

 to let operators know its position and avoid other vessels. The operating crew used Global Situational Awareness via Internet (G-SAVI) technology, which enabled them to remotely access a CCTV feed, thermal data and radar; as well as communicate with surrounding

 vessels.

14840,30/09/2019,Jason Dinsdale,There is evidence that the fertiliser industry is starting to consider how ammonia could contribute to a future energy economy.,"The Environment Agency is already involved in regulating ammonia emissions from agricultural installations. These impacts could be potentially dwarfed by the realisation of an ammonia economy. European trade association Fertilizers Europe, which has UK trade

 association connections recently published a report examining the drivers shaping the fertiliser industry out to 2030. Of note in “Feeding Life 2030” is the assumed increased importance of ammonia in the energy mix. The report suggests that ten per cent of

 European ammonia could be produced from renewable electricity power electrolysis to generate the required hydrogen feedstock. This in itself would require green ammonia production to scale up capacity to more than a million tons per year, within ten years.

 The report also outlines a vision for the fertiliser industry using ammonia production as the key to creating a carbon-free energy storage medium. Echoing this ambition are two research projects in Australia and Denmark. The Australian project has developed

 a ‘reverse fuel cell’ that uses renewable energy, nitrogen gas and water to produce ammonia gas without the heat pressure and carbon emissions of conventional industrial production, aka Haber-Bosch process. The ammonia produced can then be piped to ammonia

 fuelled power stations, or be broken down again to extract hydrogen fuel. The Danish project, SOC4NH3 (Solid Oxide Cell based production and use of ammonia) is similar in its concept and aims, but will focus on using wind power, compared to the plentiful supply

 of renewable solar in Australia. Research has also emerged on the feasibility of China adopting large scale ammonia production as a means to transport energy from distant renewable sources in Western and Northern areas to large markets in the Centre and East.

 This suggests the technologies currently being developed may have demand markets opening up to them, both from industry and government. As a regulator the Environment Agency may need to consider the implications of an ammonia economy, which could range from

 production and emission regulations to concerns around leakage from old infrastructure, incident management considerations and wider environmental impacts.",https&%2358;//www.ammoniaenergy.org/feeding-life-2030-the-vision-of-fertilizers-europe/,Feeding Life 2030&%2358; the vision of Fertilizers Europe,Error - action required,09/05/2019,"Brown, T","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/07/ammonia-renewable-fuel-made-sun-air-and-water-could-power-globe-without-carbon"">Ammonia-a renewable fuel made from sun, air, and water-could power the globe without carbon - Science 12/07/2018</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//blog.topsoe.com/ammonia-can-become-the-co2-free-fuel-of-the-future"">Ammonia can become the CO2-free fuel of the future - Haldor Topsoe 21/02/2019</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.ammoniaenergy.org/ammonia-as-an-environmentally-benign-energy-carrier-for-the-fast-growth-of-china/"">Ammonia as an environmentally benign energy carrier for the fast growth of China - Ammonia Energy 18/03/2019</a></p>",Error - action required,,,Error - action required,,DFOS,3 - some development needed,DFOS,energy ammonia agriculture fertiliser chemical chemistry &quot;Fertlizers Europe&quot; &quot;trade association&quot; &quot;Feeding Life 2030&quot; 2030 energy storage reverse fuel cell Denmark Australia nitrogen hydrogen emission infrastructure catalyst SOC4NH3 &quot;Solid Oxide Cell&quot;  China transport renewable solar wind regulation ,No,Yes,No,No,No,,"energy, emission, regulation",,,,[],18/05/2022 11:45,"Loveday, Tim",17/05/2021 12:01,"Loveday, Tim",0,,"15,217",,,Jason Dinsdale

It has also pointed to several key features of the political, social and economic landscape that may shape its development.

 In a press conference Lieutenant General Jack Shanahan (Director of the Department of Defense’s Joint A.I Centre) acknowledged the need to incorporate ethical concerns around the potential future uses of AI into both the initial project problem framing and

 longer term development processes. While making the point was made that the technology was still in its relative infancy he indicated that there was a longer term need to establish a wider set of international norms around its development and use internationally.

 To do that the General highlighted the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons in Geneva as a key forum for discussion. These concerns were framed in the context of wider geopolitical strategic competition between the US, Russia and China.     The event of the press conference itself reinforces this narrative by pointing to potentially important differences in the political environment of each of these countries that could lead to differences in AI’s development. Perhaps in contrast to other

 nations the U.S military have identified a need to garner and maintain public support for what they’re doing. It’s not clear whether comparable challenges are a feature of other socio-political niches. Understanding the dynamics and potential paths of A.I’s

The model employs a top down approach that combines econometric estimates of per capita energy demand with projected changes

 in the number of hot (over 27.5 degrees) and cold (below 12.5 degrees) days. Under a vigorous warming scenario global climate dependent energy demand is shown to increase by 25 – 58% between now and, before adaptation, and by 11 – 27% under a moderate warming

 scenario. These increases are in addition to projected rises in demand as a result of socio-economic development over the same period, accounting for the effects of population and economic growth. Importantly changes in energy demand are shown to vary considerably

 across different global regions. The highest increases are projected to occur across the Americas, Africa, the Middle East and South and South Eastern Asia while areas of Europe, Russia and Canada are projected to experience reductions in energy demand. Consequently

 the data point to the potential for changing energy needs to fall unevenly across the global population, further entrenching existing inequalities. These findings should be of interest to the Environment Agency both in terms of there potential domestic and

 international implications.

 stronger amongst poorer less developed nations, which have adapted more quickly. The reduction is attributed to investment in protective measures against climate hazards both in terms of the response and recovery phases across all nation states. But despite

 the relative narrowing of levels of vulnerability between the richest and poorest nations the evidence indicates that a considerable absolute gap in vulnerability between the richest and poorest nations still remains. The implications of the data for the Environment

RocketLab is a company specialising in small satellite launches. It recently announced that it will provide

 a customisable service, from build through to launch, where customers can tailor satellite instrumentation to their specific needs, as opposed to utilising third party instrumentation and data which may not be the best fit to their specific need. Customers

 of Photon will have the chance to add their own instrumentation to a satellite’s payload. Photon has a much larger payload compared to Cubesat (%2314139) and also has thrusters for maneuverability. Another cheap access route to satellite launch could come from

 steam filled balloons. This development may challenge the notion of rocket based payload deployment and its associated environmental concerns, such as air pollution and carbon footprint(%2315054). Another company is about to apply knowledge gleaned from satellite

 data to monitor air pollution from every single power plant on Earth in real time. The non-profit company called WattTime, backed by Google, will be using a combination of satellite images from Landsat and other sources and artificial intelligence (AI). The

 data will come from a variety of sensors operating at different wavelengths, including thermal infrared that can detect heat. WattTime will output real time emissions data to the public, effectively exposing any poor on the ground monitoring or discrepancies

 between actual and reported emissions, eliminating a significant barrier to citizen action and providing independent third party data to check emissions data against - much air pollution data is suspected to go unreported. A similar open source project is

 to focus on global methane emissions producing open source data. This development could have a significant impact on holding environmental regulators and the energy sector to account, but could also provide a useful tool for collaborative regulation. Trust

 exact process varies between companies, but it is currently being embraced by the technology sector. Some processes involve consulting with colleagues before putting in a request. Companies who have pursued this include Smarkets and Corporate Rebels.The thought

 behind this initiative is that it attracts the best talent and increases staff retention. It also relies on and encourages greater transparency between colleagues and the business itself. Another trend growing amongst tech companies is unlimited leave, including

 Evernote, Netflix and UK based consultancy Inbucon. Despite concerns that people would abuse the privilege, it was found that people didn’t take significantly greater time off than previous. Trust was cited as being hugely important in implementing this policy,

 and may not suit larger companies. One potential consequence of these schemes reaching wider acceptance. is that even if the intentions are good it may lead to people taking lower salaries or less leave for fear of appearing uncompetitive next to their colleagues.

14831,26/09/2019,Jason Dinsdale,"The Fourth Industrial Revolution has scarcely begun, but already there is speculation on the shape of the Fifth Industrial Revolution.","The Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) was first outlined in 2015. It is characterised by technologies that combine hardware, software, and biology, with an emphasis on communication and connectivity. Technologies such as robotics, artificial intelligence,

 nanotechnology, quantum computing, biotechnology, the internet of things (IOT), decentralisation and 3D printing exemplify these developments. One theme perceived to run through this and previous industrial revolutions is a dehumanisation of economic progress

 and an increase in existential threat to both humans and the environment. The technologies of 4IR could exacerbate this trend by eclipsing human performance and capability while failing to tackle issues such as pollution and population increase. The Fifth

 Industrial Revolution (5IR) will see these same technologies ‘bent back’ in the service of humans, contributing to the greater good of environmental outcomes and human wellbeing. 5IR will ask of people how they can make the World ‘better’, rather than ‘more

 efficient’ or ‘more productive’. Companies will seek ‘profit with purpose’, responding to consumer demand for more ethical and environmentally friendly goods and services. AI and robotics will work to enhance an increasingly democratised return on investment

 (ROI), and help to meet sustainable development goals such as closing the gender pay gap. Work will become more flexible, fitting around people’s lives rather than vice versa.New roles could emerge, such as a chief ethical and humane use officer. 5IR could

 mean new economic systems dubbed by one writer as ‘automated luxury communism’ where technology has eliminated jobs, but still provides people’s needs such as food and energy, allowing people to enjoy better lives. Another view of 5ID sees it in the context

 of previous industrial revolutions&%2358; 1IR - mechanical; 2IR - electrical; 3IR - digital; 4IR - virtual (autonomous vehicles, 3D printing etc have at their hearts virtual representations of the real world) to 5IR - neural as the fruits of 4IR enable greater seamlessness

 and potential for creativity between the digital world and the human brain. Recent news emerging of Facebook's purchase of a company called CTRL-labs that specialises in devices that convert electrical impulses from the human body into movements onscreen exemplifies

 the trajectory that neural technology may take.

A space probe that recently crash landed on the

 moon containing animal and plant life could be seen as introducing invasive species in a different future context (though this may also prove a valuable ark of species and DNA in the future). An astronaut has also been accused of the first ‘space crime’, allegedly

 hacking into their estranged spouse’s finances whilst on a mission. And the first commercial space terminal on Earth has just opened. These events could represent signals that there could be an increasing need for regulation of space as well as Earth. Considering

 the environmental damage that industry creates there are lots of potential environmental gains from removing industry entirely from the confines of the Earth. There is already private investment going into asteroid mining (%2313368), which could exploit up to

 $8 billion of minerals within ‘easy’ reach. The concept of ‘in-situ utilisation’ would involve extracting, processing and manufacturing products off-planet resources in space, which could have big advantages in terms of reducing payloads and on-planet pollution.

 Technologies such as additive manufacturing using multiple materials could be used, and take advantage of zero gravity conditions, which could, for example, assist with 3D printing body parts (though this need may already have been surpassed by terrestrial

 technology). Space may also be utilised for renewable energy generation in the form of uninterrupted solar power - without a significant breakthrough in semiconductor technology such as quantum computing the Earth could run out of energy to power the World’s

 computers by 2040. Other energy sources in space include ice, which could be separated into hydrogen and water using lasers, providing the building blocks for propulsion fuels for autonomous craft. The costs of launching objects into space using rockets may

 be about to be challenged through the development of a kinetic energy-based launch system that accelerates the launch vehicle to hypersonic speeds using ground-based energy. The company developing this systems is called Spinlaunch. They claim to provide a

 substantially lower launch to orbit cost that can be deployed multiple times per day, without negative environmental impacts. With so much potential for economic and resource gain from space exploitation there may also be environmental considerations for the

 longer term protection of both the Earth and space, such as around waste and emissions. Such internationally agreed regulations are currently absent, particularly for non-governmental agents, presenting a familiar situation where technology and the private

 sector are ‘ahead of the game’ compared to governance and regulation.",http&%2358;//blogs.discovermagazine.com/crux/2019/07/02/space-mining-off-planet-industry/,Made in space&%2358; why Earth's industries might one day leave our planet,Discover Magazine,02/07/2019,"Farah, T","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//interestingengineering.com/is-it-already-time-to-have-laws-for-outer-space"">Is it already time to have laws for outer space? - Interesting Engineering 20/07/2019</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-46944972"">Why your new heart could be made in space one day - BBC 22/01/2019</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.cnet.com/news/carbon-3d-pushes-new-3d-printing-technology-like-using-multiple-materials/"">This startup wants to 3D-print your next running shoe or dentures - CNet 25/06/2019</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190619005661/en/SpinLaunch-Secures-Contract-Revolutionary-New-Space-Launch"">SpinLaunch secures first contract for revolutionary new space launch services - Business Wire 19/06/2019</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.virgingalactic.com/articles/virgin-galactic-opens-the-doors-to-the-gateway-to-space/"">Virgin Galactic opens the doors to the `gateway to space' - Virgin 15/08/2019</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.nytimes.com/2019/08/23/us/nasa-astronaut-anne-mcclain.html"">NASA astronaut Anne McClain accused by spouse of crime in space - The New York Times 23/08/2019</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//bgr.com/2019/08/06/tardigrades-moon-lander-beresheet/"">Crashed Israeli lunar lander left a bunch of microscopic `water bears' on the Moon - BGR 06/08/2019</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.haaretz.com/science-and-health/.premium-israeli-scientists-print-world-s-first-3-d-heart-1.7124321"">Israeli scientists print World's first 3-D heart - Haaretz.com 15/04/2019</a></p>",Error - action required,,,Error - action required,,DFOS,4 - signficant development needed,DFOS,regulation space manufacturing &quot;additive manufacturing&quot; mineral &quot;3D printing&quot; astronaut law legislation SpinLaunch satellite launch renewable energy quantum computing laser water ‘in-situ utilisation’ factory payload cost fuel private company government invasive species solar generation &quot;asteroid mining&quot;,No,Yes,No,No,No,,"regulation, business, manufacturing, space, legislation",,,,[],18/05/2022 11:45,"Loveday, Tim",17/05/2021 12:01,"Loveday, Tim",0,,"15,204",,,Jason Dinsdale

As the ability of machines to carry out the tasks of human workers develops and they become able to work more effectively

 and more efficiently than their human counterparts, there is concern that they will begin to supersede people in the work place. For this reason, among others, researchers have over the past few years been attempting to understand the rate at which AI might

 develop, and in particular the point at which it’ll have the ability to surpass the performance of human workers (the point of Higher Learning Machine Intelligence - HLMI). Using survey based methodologies, investigators have focused on drawing together the

 insights of key experts in relevant fields, as well as other well positioned figures, to develop credible estimates of the arrival of HLMI. While there is considerable uncertainty connected with the data, and the conclusions drawn from it should be interpreted

 with caution, these estimates do represent the best available understanding of when these changes might start to take place. Three of the 4 projections included provide substantially similar timelines, which suggest that there is more than a 90% confidence

 level that there is a 50% chance or more of HLMI emerging around 50 years from now, or about 2075. The fourth projection is more conservative in its estimate and indicates that the point at which there is a greater than 50% chance of HLMI arriving will be

 around the year 2100, or shortly afterwards. However, what’s clear is that the development of AI over the intervening period is also expected to begin having significant impacts on the workplace well in advance of these dates, pointing to a need for the EA

 at multiple points in the pharmaceutical lifecycle – the ‘chain’ - by identifying points of action across all of the elements of production and consumption, from development and manufacturing to prescription and use, and during the waste water treatment phase.

 Consequently the policy approach has the potential to deliver a coordinated response to the problem, overcoming problems of technological ‘lock in’ that have restrict more sectoral approaches. It’s particularly relevant to us in the EA because of the closely

A US study looking at how warming temperatures affect native and non-native

 plant species in terms of flowering. Flowering timing is important to plant survival as it determines whether a plant will be pollinated by bees and other insects, and if it will be able to produce seed. When simulating warming conditions on groups of native

 and non-native potted plants researchers observed that non-native species flowered more than 11 days earlier on average. In contrast the flowering times of non-native plants did not change. The earlier flowering species were also found to have a greater geographical

 spread, suggesting that earlier flowering enables this. The study was focussed on the USA, and therefore may not directly apply to other areas of the World. However it does suggest that warming temperatures may be to the advantage of invasive plants, and to

14822,02/08/2019,Jason Dinsdale,New research suggests that undersea methane hydrate deposits could be a valid storage medium for carbon dioxide.,"Methane hydrate, also known as fire ice is formed in the deep ocean floor when rotting organic matter releases methane. The high pressure and cold temperature of sea water causes the ice-like solid methane hydrate to form. There are thought to be vast deposits

 of methane hydrate on the ocean floor with the potential to be a significant source of fossil fuel natural gas. In recent times the promise of cheap and plentiful fuel has led to some countries including Japan, China and India (%2314323) developing the technology

 to exploit these deposits. It’s also thought that some hydrate deposits may be found in UK waters (%2314300). There are also concerns that exploiting methane hydrate could lead to significant greenhouse gas releases which would contribute to climate change.

 New research has modelled the feasibility of using undersea hydrate as a storage medium for carbon dioxide. Computer modelling demonstrated that when air and carbon dioxide are injected into methane hydrate, the nitrogen in the air sweeps the methane towards

 an extraction point, allowing CO2 to replace it, effectively address carbon capture and storage concerns (though it isn’t clear if there is a like-for-like replacement). Proof that methane replacement is possible could mean that climate change concerns around

 hydrate exploitation are addressed. However methane is a more potent greenhouse gas than CO2. While this particular method may be touted as ‘green’ there could be wider concerns from a realised hydrate industry around the impacts of methane leakage and potential

 disturbance of ocean habitats.

This research exposed freshwater insects to environmentally relevant levels of thiacloprid. Although there was no observed increase in mortality, all sub lethal levels

 and physical world through more natural human computer interfaces.","These developments could in turn have implications for how electronic waste is produced and disposed, and therefore has implications for the Environment Agency’s waste management activities. Researchers in Switzerland have used CRISPR gene editing technology

 to edit protein genes. The resulting gene represents a flexible core processor, or central processing unit (CPU), that accepts different kinds of programming, and receives inputs as RNA molecules called guide RNA. In responding to the guide RNA sequences the

 CPU regulates the expression of a particular gene, which in turn makes a particular protein. Using this approach it is possible to program scalable circuits in human cells. Such ‘computational organs’ could theoretically attain computing power that far outstrips

 that of a digital supercomputer, using a fraction of the energy. It could also lead to cells that emit warning, or ‘build’ substances in response to the presence of certain markers. Another group of scientists in Italy have managed to significantly increase

 the conductivity of melanin. The billion fold increase was achieved through heating eumelanin in a vacuum. Melanin’s biocompatibility could mean that it may be much easier to create implanted electronic devices. Another exploration of biocompatibility centres

 around experimenting with quantum materials as potential brain/computer interfaces. Quantum materials have electronic properties that classical physics can’t explain, unlike other materials used in electronics, such as silicon. Whereas electronic circuits

 function through the movement of electrons, brains work through the movement of ions. The behaviour of the quantum material (made of perovskite nickelate) placed beneath a brain’s surface suggested that it could provide a potential bridge between ion and electron

 movement. The quantum material is also sensitive detecting brain chemistry levels, and could therefore provide an early sign of decreasing dopamine levels, for example which could suggest the onset of Parkinson’s disease. Biological memory loss could be supplemented

 with digital memory support through the interface, but further development is needed to allow the brain and quantum material to be able to ‘talk’ to each other. These developments have similarities with using DNA for data storage (%2314730).",https&%2358;//blog.frontiersin.org/2019/03/26/will-cyborgs-circuits-be-made-from-melanin/,Will cyborg circuits be made from melanin?,Error - action required,26/03/2019,,"<p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.pnas.org/content/116/15/7214"">A CRISPR/Cas9-based central processing unit to program complex logic computation in human cells - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 09/04/2019</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2019/Q2/new-quantum-material-could-warn-of-neurological-disease.html"">New quantum material could warn of neurological disease - Purdue University 10/04/2019</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-09660-6?_ga=2.240695939.1259952406.1564481644-1204085162.1564481644"">Perovskite nickelates as bio-electronic interfaces - Nature 30/07/2019</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//ethz.ch/content/main/en/news-and-events/eth-news/news/2019/04/biosynthetic-dual-core-cell-computer.html"">A biosynthetic dual-core cell computer - ETH Zurich 16/04/2019</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fchem.2019.00162/full?utm_source=fweb&amp;utm_medium=nblog&amp;utm_campaign=ba-sci-fchem-melanin-cyborgs"">Evidence of unprecedented high electronic conductivity in mammalian pigment based eumelanin thin films after thermal annealing in vacuum - Frontiers In Chemistry 26/03/2019</a></p>",Error - action required,,,Error - action required,,DFOS,4 - signficant development needed,DFOS,waste management disposal electronic waste WEEE circuit silicon metal biology biocompatability DNA data  &quot;central processing unit&quot; CPU RNA gene expression protein CRISPR &quot;computational organ&quot; melanin eumelanin quantum material perovskite nickelate bio-electronic interface IT data digital health disease brain Parkinson's monitoring electron ion dopamine regulation manufacturing  workforce employee employer health safety wellbeing,No,Yes,No,No,No,,"waste management, electronics",,,,[],18/05/2022 11:45,"Loveday, Tim",17/05/2021 12:01,"Loveday, Tim",0,,"15,197",,,Jason Dinsdale

Facebook's endorsement of Libra will help legitimize the idea of digital currency and build confidence in distributed trust technologies. Many governments

 are uncomfortable with the idea of this new currency, as they fear the impact it may have on traditional government backed currencies, the potential for disruption and the power it may give corporations such as Facebook over global financial systems. The US

 government have even asked Facebook to delay the launch of the currency until they have had chance to investigate it further. This latest cryptocurrency has a number of well known partners (Uber, Ebay, Paypal, Spotify, Visa, and Mastercard), further increasing

 the legitimacy of the product. Facebook has 2.4 billion users worldwide, so if this currency caught on, it could have significant global impacts. It has the potential to help facilitate the development of a decentralised internet (HSDBi 15078), that offers

 users more control of their own data. This would disrupt many business models which rely on this data to create their profits. As users become more familiar with the technology, they may prefer it to traditional banking for its ease and convenience and expect

 government organisations to accept it as a payment method. Regulating for this type of payment will be challenging. Governments are concerned with the potential for illegal use due to the anonymity of transactions. Social media is already widely used to buy

 illegal substances, if you then combine easy anonymous payments, it makes the whole process much easier and appealing to those that are worried about getting caught. This is something that has the potential to be transferrable to the waste crime sector, as

 the two. Using a novel methodology that systematically characterises expert judgments not only about well-quantified risks, but also more uncertain outcomes that they may carry; thoroughly explores how these judgments are underpinned by present-day knowledge,

 and; rigorously combines individual and collective deliberations to minimize biases, the study is able to synthesis evidence of new agreement not documented before. Accordingly claims that there is a link between climate change and armed conflict can now be

 put on a firmer footing, although the authors still point out its relative contribution is likely to be small compared to other contributors. Connectedly new evidence has been published pointing to a possible link between climate change and asylum seeking,

 expensive cost savings could be incurred through scaling and reduced need to be reapplied. Dutch researchers are looking for oil alternatives in biomass, including agricultural and organic waste streams, developing ‘green’ cosmetics, detergents, paints and

 plastics that reduce CO₂ emissions and result in a healthier environment. One example is extracting polyacrylates used in dishwasher tablets from sugar beet and isocyanates free resin made from vegetable oil (isocyanates can be harmful to humans). Finnish

 designers have devised environmentally friendly concept headphones, made from naturally derived materials such as 3D printed bioplastics, hydrophobin protein based foam (derived from fungus) and artificially produced spider silk (the headphones don’t currently

 function as electronic devices).

 threat to food security and human health. The authors suggest that a more integrated system is needed for weed control, so that farmers are not reliant on chemistry alone. The environmental pathways of resistance, be it bacteria, fungal or plant, are new areas

As a result it’s now more plausible that hydrogen could displace fossil fuel use in both the home and transport sectors, potentially contributing

 to reduced carbon dioxide emissions and achieving greenhouse gas emission targets. The small scale of the new technology may also have implications for the way fuels are currently manufactured and distributed, signalling a move away from centralised large

 scale production systems and towards smaller more decentralised and localised neighbourhood or household units. This is potentially significant to the Environment Agency in terms of its role in monitoring and regulating air pollution, its role in helping to

 reduce carbon emissions from the energy sector and the new demands of regulating changes in fuel manufacturing arrangements and their associated infrastructural distribution networks. Hydrogen production currently occurs at relatively large scales but at a

 high price compared to fossil fuels and its reliance on grid electricity has limited uptake. One solution to this has been to try and integrate the function of electrical power generation and electrolysis into single devices, like the generator featured here,

 to increase the efficiency of the process. To date devices have regularly achieved solar to hydrogen efficiencies in excess of 10% but in order to achieve the required cost efficiencies have needed to utilise membranes that are chemically unstable. A solution

 to this, successfully tested under laboratory conditions, has been to use water vapour rather than liquid phase water. The new solar generator incorporates this technology into an operational, deployable device for the first time and in doing so achieves solar

 still exist for conservation? While a conceptual exercise this project raises questions around the concept of natural capital. Assuming that climate change cannot be halted, it is likely that many habitats may be transformed or disappear completely, changing

The ability to communicate and influence animal behaviour with robotics is also of interest from a wider environmental perspective

 as it may offer the potential for monitoring and improving the resilience of ecosystems in the face of large scale systematic change. A UK based company, Animal Dynamics, is one of several to be exploring the potential of replicating animal characteristics

 in robots designed for air, land and water. One of its most promising developments is a pen sized insect-like drone for military reconnaissance called Skeeter. Others are experimenting with robotic insects for pollination and surveillance purposes (%2314610,

 %2314669, %236809). One group of researchers has been investigating how robots can influence groups of animals. Robotic bees and fish have been used to influence the direction taken by swarms and schools respectively. In one experiment enticing the fish in one

 direction led to communication with the bee robot, who reciprocated the same influence on the swarm, effectively creating primitive cross species communication. It is envisaged that such robots could adapt by evolutionary algorithms, learning to interact with

 animals in a desired way. This could lay the foundations for a new mechanism for humans to interfere with animal societies in order to manage the environment and utilise the collective unrivalled perceptual capabilities of animals to enhance decision making,

 and making the selective rewiring of ecosystems an outcome. The term for this new branch of technology has been coined&%2358; “biohybridity”. It is suggested that animal-robot hybrids could even replace us as the new 'toiling masses' of the 21st century. The prospect

 of using such technology for managing environmental systems may create uncertainties over what the ‘correct’ approach could be, however with a rapidly changing climate, more technologically enhanced solutions may be needed to keep natural ecosystems functioning,

 food crops. It is not clear if the use of these fungicides could have played a part in the development of resistant strains. However it is troubling that the majority of antifungals all work the same way, meaning if more strains become resistant there are

An increase in the rate of innovation could also create greater challenges for regulation, which historically

 has always lagged behind. Recent research has demonstrated that the cost of producing new ideas is increasing - productivity has been sluggish for several decades, despite increasing numbers of researchers. This pattern can be seen across disciplines including

 crop science, drug discovery and semiconductor development - Moore’s Law for example has remained true but at a significantly growing cost to research. The implications are significant. Some suspect that humanity has already harvested the ‘low hanging fruit’

 of innovation at a time when significant existential threats such as climate change and antimicrobial resistance are coming to the fore. As the sheer volume of knowledge expands it becomes harder for humans to master their whole fields of knowledge, so they

 tend to specialise. This makes it necessary to employ larger teams to solve complex problems, which in itself increases potential costs. While some of the issues could be resolved through economic means, such as tax breaks for R&amp;D, the most impactful solution

 may be in embracing the potential of artificial intelligence and machine learning. AI is already helping to explore the properties of molecules with the potential to create new pharmaceuticals, which a human workforce could never screen in an effective time

 frame. The discovery of new materials could take 2-5 years, rather than the expected 10-20 years within the current paradigm. AI also has the potential to come up with ideas that humans would never have thought of on their own - Google’s AI discovered strategies

 for the game Go that no human had ever conceived. At the same time human input would still be needed - our understanding of the systems we wish to improve are imperfect - human disease mechanisms for example - and machine intelligence could only help to solve

 these issues if it is presented with the right data in the first place.",https&%2358;//www.technologyreview.com/s/612898/ai-is-reinventing-the-way-we-invent/?goal=0_b95dee6ddf-ae2d846401-180976285,AI is reinventing the way we invent,MIT,15/02/2019,"Rotman, D","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/eth-news/news/2019/03/blog-schneider-ai-drug-development.html"">How AI could spur drug development - ETH Zurich 28/03/2019</a></p>",Error - action required,,,Error - action required,,DFOS,3 - some development needed,DFOS,research development innovation &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; &quot;machine learning&quot; productivity investment economics tax resources Google &quot;Alpha Go&quot; AI drug pharmaceutical chemical &quot;semi conductor&quot;  &quot;Moore's Law&quot; AMR &quot;climate change&quot;,No,Yes,No,No,No,,"artificial intelligence, research, innovation, economics",,,,[],18/05/2022 11:45,"Loveday, Tim",17/05/2021 12:00,"Loveday, Tim",0,,"15,167",,,Jason Dinsdale

14788,25/04/2019,Becky LeAnstey,Evidence suggests that road salts have a negative impact on multiple aquatic species.,"The concentration of salt in freshwater environments such as rivers, lakes and wetlands is increasing due to human activities. De-icing of roads is one source of this salt, but other activities such as agricultural practices, mining, and irrigation all add

 to the rising concentrations. Although there has been research on the ecological effects of salinization in the past, it took until 2001 for a review of the evidence of these impacts across species. Since this point research in the topic has increased significantly.

 This current review looked at the research available on the effects of salinisation on aquatic species. It found that although not lethal, it had an impact on species growth and reproduction as well as altering nutrient flows in the waterbodies. This was the

 case for both fish and biofilms, with the authors highlighting evidence gaps for a number of other species that need further research. As the evidence builds on the impacts of salinization on freshwater species there will likely be a push to find alternatives

 to keep roads safe. The Environment Agency will likely have a role to play in helping reduce the impacts, and will need to be mindful of any innovative alternatives and what their ecological impact could be. This has already been seen with beet juice deicer

The energy and resource differences between artificial and conventional livestock rearing could also bring significant differences to the sector’s environmental

 impacts. Medical researchers have developed an artificial womb known as a Biobag. The Biobag contains an electrolyte solution similar to amniotic fluid and a way for the fetus to circulate its blood and exchange carbon dioxide for oxygen - similar to a uterus.

 The researchers have used Biobags to bring eight fetal lambs to term. The intention is for the Biobag to offer a more natural environment for premature births to develop in, and to offer an alternative to situations where there are health risks to natural

 pregnancies. This is not to say that such technology may not be utilised for other purposes within the livestock industry and beyond. Previous intelligence has demonstrated that there may be a market for mass produced genetically cloned livestock (HSDBi %2313664),

 which are being established in China to address the rising global demand for meat. And conceptual schemes to use natural environmental management to tackle climate change using mammoths would in reality only become feasible through using artificial wombs.

 The resource demands and financial risks of livestock breeding, such as feed and veterinary bills may be either partly or completely reduced through artificial wombs. Breeding cycles may no longer be seasonal, and the number of live young could rise overall.

 Livestock produced in such a way may represent a halfway house between the real and the synthetic, and may therefore be seen as more palatable to consumers, who currently aren’t completely sure about lab grown meat. Artificial womb technology may also impact

 on human reproduction.People currently excluded from biological parenthood through infertility or other reasons may take advantage of artificial wombs. As the technology matures to a stage of full ectogenesis it is conceivable that given the choice some women

 may opt out of pregnancy yet still become mothers. Men may also be able to skip courtship on the road to becoming fathers. Wealthy people could pay to have more children than they might conceive naturally.There may be developmental or behavioural impacts of

 any offspring, animal or human that haven’t been being biologically attached to a mother. Practical and ethical issues around such things as abortion and adoption may lead to social division, legal and regulatory challenges. The impacts on population dynamics

 as a whole may also bring consequences for resource use and environmental impacts.",https&%2358;//www.theverge.com/2017/4/25/15421734/artificial-womb-fetus-biobag-uterus-lamb-sheep-birth-premie-preterm-infant,An artificial womb successfully grew baby sheep - and humans could be next,Error - action required,25/04/2017,,"<p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.heraldnet.com/opinion/harrop-are-we-ready-to-confront-ethics-of-artificial-wombs/"">Harrop&%2358; Are we ready to confront ethics of artificial wombs? - Everett Daily Herald 03/01/2019</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//futurism.com/glimpse-deextinction-mammoths-global-warming-glimpse-2"">Glimpse&%2358; how an army of resurrected mammoths could curb global warming - Futurism 27/09/2018</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.babygaga.com/artificial-wombs-future-of-childbearing/"">Could artificial wombs replace women in the future? - BabyGaga 15/02/2019</a></p><p><a href=""http&%2358;//theconversation.com/would-you-eat-meat-from-a-lab-consumers-arent-necessarily-sold-on-cultured-meat-100933"">Would you eat `meat' from a lab?

The probable explanation for this delay is that extinctions eliminate morphospace (the

 possible forms, shapes or structures of organisms), as they curtail diversity, and the delay in diversification is a result of the time needed for new innovations to rebuild morphospace, which can then be filled out by newly evolved species. To test this hypothesis,

 the study reconstructed the impacts of the meteor strike in the Cretaceous period on foraminifera plankton, which showed that increases in complexity precede changes in diversity, indicating that plankton colonised new morphospace, then slowly filled it in

 urban air quality is noticeably poor and the logistics of purifying the relatively small indoor spaces where people spend the majority of their time make sense. However there is also a growing number of air purification devices available on the UK market.

 Recently one London school installed air purification technology to reduce PM2.5 levels in classrooms due to health concerns. One design of air purifier features a charcoal filter which captures air impurities such as particulate matter, heavy metals from

 brake wear, polycyclic aromatic compounds from wood and coal fires, nitrosamines from cigarette smoke and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These substances exist in the air at low concentrations, but these become concentrated within the filter. When the

 filters are replaced the old ones end up in landfill&%2358; if large numbers of households install purification technology then this could equate to a concentration of toxic material in landfill, rather than in the air. As public awareness of the health impacts

 of poor air quality grows and the availability of purification technology increases, this could emerge as an issue in the UK, particularly if national policy fails to address air pollution issues to a level the public deem is satisfactory.",https&%2358;//theconversation.com/air-purification-is-catching-on-but-it-may-be-doing-more-harm-than-good-111309,Air purification is catching on - but it may be doing more harm than good,The Conversation,19/02/2019,"Lewis, A","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.standard.co.uk/news/london/london-school-fits-air-purifiers-in-classrooms-to-protect-children-a3721771.html"">London school fits air purifiers in classrooms to protect children from toxic air - Evening Standard 22/12/2017</a></p>",Error - action required,,,Error - action required,,DFOS,2 - near to realisation,DFOS,&quot;air quality&quot; &quot;air pollution&quot; pollution &quot;air purification&quot; &quot;air purifier&quot; domestic health household indoor government policy regulation filter brake dust charcoal nitrosamine cigarette smoke urban London school PM2.5 VOC &quot;heavy metal&quot; &quot;particulate matter&quot;  &quot;polycyclic aromatic compound&quot; wood coal fire waste landfill,No,Yes,No,No,No,,"air quality, waste, technology, regulation",,,,[],18/05/2022 11:45,"Loveday, Tim",17/05/2021 12:00,"Loveday, Tim",0,,"15,154",,,Jason Dinsdale

 ways. This could translate into different impacts on behaviour. The ‘gut-brain axis’ is an increasing area of interest for medical research, giving weight to the idea of the gut being a second brain. Changes to gut microbiota can therefore impact on brain

 activity and mental function. The experiment on mice suggests that emulsifiers may induce similar impacts on humans. However there is also a consideration that emulsifiers may not be removed during water treatment, or may enter the environment through food

Recent

 developments have seen other technology companies, including Google, venturing into air quality monitoring (%2314849), water quality monitoring (MIGHT ADD THIS AS AN HSDBi ARTICLE,) and flood forecasting (%2315059). According to recent filings to CDP, an environmental

 impact assessment company, Apple sees itself benefitting from the extreme weather effects of climate change as mobile communication becomes important during these events. Customers may have an increasing need for “confidence and preparedness”, which Apple

 products such as the iPhone can help fulfill. Users may increasingly value immediate and reliable communications with emergency services and loved ones. Phones can provide emergency aid instructions, plus light and sound to attract attention, and can be kept

 charged with minimal energy use. Apple has also recently filed a patent for a poisonous gas sensor that is integral to a smartphone or smart device, just as GPS is today. The sensor is made from a silicon-based substrate with gas sensing electrodes on top.

 A third filtering layer would only let in gases of interest, which could include sulphur dioxide, methane, and carbon monoxide (CO). While this sensor seems to have been developed as a survival device (carbon monoxide kills around 50 people per year in the

 UK and hospitalises hundreds more), it may also have application as a passive air quality sensor. If fitted as standard, as GPS is these days then it could open up the potential of millions of air quality sensors that would give a more detailed picture of

14767,15/03/2019,sbrown,"The impacts of automation on the workplace will not be felt evenly across society, according to recent findings.","This should be of interest to the Environment Agency as it may present both challenges and opportunities for workplace diversity. One recent piece of US focussed research from the Brookings Institution suggests that automation is likely to impact non-white,

 less economically secure workers more. The task based research indicated that around between 44 and 47 per cent of tasks performed by Hispanic, Black and Native American workers could be automated over the next twenty years, compared to 40 per cent of tasks

 performed by white workers. Youth was also a factor with younger workers aged between 16 and 24 likely to have half their tasks automated over the same period. The research also identified men as slightly more likely to be impacted by automation than women.

 Another piece of research conducted by PWC drew similar conclusions. PWC identified three waves of automation, each of which would impact on workplace demographics in different ways. The first ‘algorithm wave’ (automation of simple computational tasks and

 analysis of structured data) and second ‘augmentation wave’ (automation of repeatable tasks, exchanging information through dynamic technological support, and statistical analysis of unstructured data) are most likely to impact on women, who tend to work in

 process led tasks. However as the third ‘autonomy wave’ (automation that involves problem solving in dynamic real-world situations with responsive actions) arrives, men are more likely to be replaced as women find work on roles more suited to the characteristics

 of caring and empathy. While both these forecasts are based on technological capability, rather than political or legislative drivers that could temper or counteract the impacts of automation, any workplace planning activities may need to be mindful that there

 is significant potential for demographic disruption from artificial intelligence, machine learning and <b>robot</b>ics.  Indeed, a further piece of economic analysis looking at the economic impacts of automation between 1993 and 2007 provides verifiable evidence that this trend may in fact already well underway. In the first economic analysis of the contribution of industrial

 robots across 17 countries investigators found that their introduction into the workplace had reduced the market share of low-skilled workers. To the extent that social minority groups are over represented in this group, they may be being disproportionately

 impacted. The research didn’t find a reduction in the total number of people employed though, suggesting that anxieties that automation might lead to higher rates of joblessness overall may be unfounded.",https&%2358;//www.wired.com/story/robots-will-take-jobs-from-men-young-minorities/,"Robots will take jobs from men, the young and minorities",Wired,24/01/2019,"Simonite, T","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/rest_a_00754"">     368pp. per issue  8 1/2 x 11  Founded&%2358; 1917  2018 Impact Factor&%2358; 3.636  2018 Google Scholar h5-index&%2358; 76  ISSN&%2358; 0034-6535  E-ISSN&%2358; 1530-9142    Follow               More About The Review           Journal Resources Editorial Info Abstracting and Indexing  Release Schedule  Advertising Info  Data Archive Site  Turnaround Times     Author Resources  Submission Guidelines   Author Publication Agreement    Author Reprints    Reader Resources  Rights and Permissions   The Review at JSTOR                         Article has an altmetric score of 39          Twitter (50)     Mendeley (392)                     29   29 total citations on Dimensions.      29 Total citations   28 Recent citations    n/a Field Citation Ratio   n/a Relative Citation Ratio       Follow                  Follow                         Robots at Work - The Review of Economics and Statistics 19/12/2018</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//qz.com/1198953/after-three-waves-of-automation-men-will-face-greater-job-losses-than-women-a-pwc-study-shows/"">Job automation will hurt women first but will ultimately hurt men more - Quartz 06/02/2018</a></p>",Error - action required,,,Error - action required,,DFOS,3 - some development needed,DFOS,workforce employment demographic employee employer automation &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; AI robot &quot;machine learning&quot; ethnic gender male female men women old young age Hispanic Black &quot;Native American&quot; &quot;Brookings Institution&quot; PWC algorithm augmentation autonomy data,No,Yes,No,No,No,,"workforce, automation, demographics",,,,[],18/05/2022 11:45,"Loveday, Tim",17/05/2021 12:00,"Loveday, Tim",0,,"15,144",,,sbrown
14766,13/03/2019,Jason Dinsdale,For the first time in the history of capitalism the World is moving en masse towards less efficient sources of energy.,"The implications of this trend are huge, transcending concerns for environmental regulation and protection, and highlight that a significant shift in how policymakers need to consider issues such as climate change, unemployment and productivity as one issue,

 rather than in isolation. As the global population grows and the economy with it, there is an increasing demand for energy to power everything from agriculture to infrastructure to entertainment. Every energy source currently employed on Earth uses energy

 in its extraction and transportation - for example something needs to power the machinery that drills the oil well. This energy is measured by the Energy Return On Investment (EROI). A high EROI means that a high ratio of energy is produced in relation to

 the energy put into the production. EROI for fossil fuels such as oil and gas have historically been reasonably high. However over time average EROI has started to fall, meaning that it is becoming increasingly energy inefficient to extract these sources.

 Renewable sources of energy including PV, wind and biomass, with the exception of hydropower, have a relatively low average EROI&%2358; this is also falling, implying that fossil fuel use is implicit in mineral extraction, manufacturing and distribution of renewable

 sources such as PV and wind (which often rely on rare metals and minerals for components). Despite producing a better quality electricity with fewer externalities (such as pollution and climate change) the EROI of renewables is complicated by the intermittent

 nature of production. Overall the ‘sink costs’ of the current economic system are not being addressed by that system. Recent volatility in political and economic systems is seen to have a root cause in ecological systems. As the ecological and economic costs

 of industrial overconsumption continue to rise, as indicated by EROI, economic growth is placed in jeopardy, in turn, creating political strain. Yet these external costs aren’t acknowledged by current economic models. Other models such as a ‘postcapitalism’

 (%2313391) based on an emancipation of labour through technology-centric solutions also require an exponential growth of energy demand. The only sustainable solution therefore is for any economic transition to involve lowering energy use through reductions in

 construction and transport and more localised production of goods and services. Such a move can only be seen to happen through concerted efforts at government level where economic activity is driven by a focus on ‘living a good life’ rather than profit. Such

 a political move would be likely to impact on all areas of government work, including the Environment Agency’s approach to regulation and flood management.",https&%2358;//www.independent.co.uk/news/long_reads/capitalism-un-scientists-preparing-end-fossil-fuels-warning-demise-a8523856.html,This is how UN scientists are preparing for the end of capitalism,The Independent,12/09/2018,"Ahmed, N","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421513003856"">EROI of different fuels and the implications for society - Energy Policy 01/01/2014</a></p>",Error - action required,,,Error - action required,,DFOS,3 - some development needed,DFOS,energy economics &quot;energy return on investment&quot; EROI sustainability growth government market transition postcapitalism &quot;climate change&quot; pollution PV wind hydropower &quot;fossil fuel&quot; oil gas coal mineral metal regulation flooding flood management,No,Yes,No,No,No,,"economics, energy, sustainability",,,,[],18/05/2022 11:45,"Loveday, Tim",17/05/2021 12:00,"Loveday, Tim",0,,"15,143",,,Jason Dinsdale

 will offer customers a ‘bundle’ energy deal, where they can have unlimited electricity usage in exchange for installing monitoring devices that track usage with increased granularity than previously seen. This data is made accessible to the energy company

 develop more efficient operations and improve demand predictions, which save them money. While it is instinctive to think that this arrangement may lead to increased energy consumption, the opposite may occur. The increased flow of data could help energy companies

 to better target customers with energy saving information and even devices. Third parties may also be able to deliver similar services through access to the data. It remains to be seen if customers will be encouraged to share more data with their energy companies,

 but if such a scheme is accepted by consumers it could revolutionise current business models around energy services. It has previously been suggested that an alternative business model based on device need rather than energy demand could also reduce use, but

Researchers in South Africa have developed a process for manufacturing bio-bricks from

 urine. The bricks are created through a natural process called microbial carbonate precipitation, similar to how seashells are formed. Loose sand is colonised with a bacteria that produce the enzyme urase, which breaks down urine to produce calcium carbonate,

 cementing the sand into whatever shape is required. By-products include nitrogen and potassium, which could be reused in fertliser manufacturing. Conventional bricks are energy intensive, requiring a kiln-firing, whereas bio-bricks can be produced at room

 temperature. There are currently practical issues around collection and social acceptance of urine based bricks that may block realisation for the meantime. In the USA scientists have developed a material that reacts with carbon dioxide to grow, strengthen

 and repair itself. The polymer made from aminopropyl methacrylamide (APMA) performs a similar process to how plants incorporate CO2 to grow. The material doesn’t require fossil fuels for manufacture and could have a range of applications. It is not yet strong

 enough for building applications but it could have a use in repairing cracks and damage. Creating construction materials like these that utilise plentiful resources without the energy and resource footprint of conventional construction materials may become

 more important when framed against the need to move towards a circular economy with sustainable resource use.",https&%2358;//www.news.uct.ac.za/article/-2018-10-24-world-first-bio-bricks-from-urine,World-first&%2358; bio-bricks from urine,Error - action required,24/10/2018,"Swingler, H","<p><a href=""http&%2358;//news.mit.edu/2018/self-healing-material-carbon-air-1011"">Self-healing material can build itself from carbon in the air - MIT 11/10/2018</a></p>",Error - action required,,,Error - action required,,DFOS,4 - signficant development needed,DFOS,construction building chemistry resources waste urine brick asset carbon dioxide self healing cement bio-brick sand bacteria enzyme urase &quot;microbial carbonate precipitation&quot; seashell fertliser nitrogen potassium energy &quot;South Africa&quot; carbon CO2 gel polymer repair maintenance &quot;circular economy&quot; &quot;aminopropyl methacrylamide&quot; APMA sustainable flooding ,No,Yes,No,No,No,,"construction, resources, chemistry",,,,[],18/05/2022 11:45,"Loveday, Tim",17/05/2021 12:00,"Loveday, Tim",0,,"15,138",,,Jason Dinsdale
14760,20/02/2019,Jason Dinsdale,Hollywood is embracing the hologram.,"As the ability to manipulate sound and vision digitally increases so does the need for performers to embrace the digitally generated world. This is leading to an emerging industry within entertainment. There is already a need for digital post production

 to ‘de-age’ actors, and recent films such as Star Wars and Fast and Furious digitally recreated deceased actors who played iconic roles within each franchise. Actors are apparently digitally preserving themselves (or at least highly accurate visual representations

 of themselves) so that they are still able to perform in the future, even if they die. This is not limited just to film - a hologram representation of deceased singer Amy Winehouse is set to tour in the near future to raise money for a charity established

 in her memory. The technologies at the cutting edge of entertainment tend to trickle down to the masses overtime as costs fall. Technologies such as Microsoft’s Hololens (%2313878) are already using representations of real people in their virtual reality (VR)

 environments. And the digital material that people generate over a lifetime such as emails, social media posts and photographs could be mined by algorithms to create a representation of that person’s intelligence (%2313539). Together these developments present

 possibilities for knowledge based businesses to divorce people and their intelligence from geography and time, allowing them to access both even if people are incapacitated or may no longer be associated with that business. Whilst this idea certainly raises

 questions around data protection and ethics, it could also mean that business knowledge lost through retirement, redundancy and other workforce disruptions could be maintained and extracted easily through conversational means, and would mean that any loss

 of knowledge and expertise through real world workforce shrinkage would be bolstered by a cohort of experienced virtual staff.",https&%2358;//www.technologyreview.com/s/612291/actors-are-digitally-preserving-themselves-to-continue-their-careers-beyond-the-grave/,Actors are digitally preserving themselves to continue their careers beyond the grave,MIT Technology Review,16/10/2018,"Winick, E","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.digitaltrends.com/news/amy-winehouse-coming-back-as-a-hologram/"">Amy Winehouse is coming back as a `hologram' for a 2019 world tour - Digital Trends 14/10/2018</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/digital-domain-digitizes-actors-performers/"">Meet the company resurrecting dead celebrities and digitally cloning living ones - Digital Trends 28/10/2018</a></p>",Error - action required,,,Error - action required,,DFOS,4 - signficant development needed,DFOS,digital data people &quot;virtual reality&quot; VR Hollywood entertainment &quot;Amy Winehouse&quot; hologram communication Microsoft Hololens &quot;social media&quot; text image &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; AI algorithm ethics workforce employee death knowledge income &quot;Star Wars&quot; &quot;Peter Cushing&quot; &quot;Fast And Furious&quot; &quot;Paul Walker&quot;,No,Yes,No,No,No,,"artificial intelligence, communication, data, ethics",,,,[],18/05/2022 11:45,"Loveday, Tim",17/05/2021 12:00,"Loveday, Tim",0,,"15,137",,,Jason Dinsdale
14759,15/02/2019,Jason Dinsdale,A substance similar to THC found in cannabis has been identified in liverwort.,"The substance called perrottetinene exhibits analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties which may be superior to those of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), currently used for some medicinal conditions centred around pain relief. Cannabis and Radula perrottetii

 liverwort are the only two plants producing psychoactive cannabinoids, which whilst can give people a ‘high’ in large doses, has pain relieving properties in low doses. Perrottetinene however appears to have a weaker psychoactive effect but be more potent

 in offering pain relief. As liverwort only grows naturally in New Zealand, Japan and Costa Rica and large amounts of perrottetinene were required for the experiments the chemical was produced via synthesis methods, suggesting that any commercial development

 would not involve the same agricultural impacts of commercial cannabis production. The interest in cannabinoids in medical and recreational use is growing. The UK has now allowed doctors to prescribe medical cannabis, and the World Health Organisation is advocating

 a rescheduling of cannabis under International drug treaties. With the possibility of wider cannabinoid use there is also a potential for environmental impact, particularly to the aquatic environment, as the impacts of other narcotics (including cannabis)

14758,12/02/2019,Jason Dinsdale,A Canadian start-up is attempting to harness the power of bacteria to turn food waste into a cheap biodegradable plastic suitable for everyday use.,"The Toronto company, called Genecis, uses bacterial action to turn kitchen waste into compostable, biocompatible plastics called PHAs (polyhydroxyalkanoates). PHA is already on the market and used in medical applications ranging from heart valves to dissolving

 sutures. It is normally made from food crops such as sugarcane and corn, which makes production costs greater than using fossil fuels. Genecis hope to address this issue through using food waste as the raw material. Food waste is first processed by other bacteria

 to break it down into digestible pieces. The plastic making bacteria then consume this was, creating PHAs as ‘body fat’ essentially. The PHA is then extracted from the bacteria and converted into pellets which can then be used in conventional plastic production.

 The company is looking to soon move from a laboratory setting to a large scale test production plant in the near future. The Environment Agency should be interested in this development. There is currently a great deal of interest in reducing single use plastics,

 and solutions such as this are therefore a potentially attractive prospect. However diverting food waste plastics production could deprive other potential routes of feedstock, such as incineration for energy, anaerobic digestion (AD) for gas energy production

14757,11/02/2019,Jason Dinsdale,"A new form of political alignment is emerging, based on geography rather than social class, and central to this is the economic productivity of urban areas.","Many have previously foreseen the technological developments of the third industrial revolution as agents to free people from conventional notions of when and where work ‘happens’. In a recent academic paper, respected futurist Andrew Curry makes the case

 that despite the availability of technology, urban areas are growing like never before. Because people are free to choose where and how they work, talented people (particularly younger workers) are opting to live in cities where a ‘thick’ labour market and

 high population density and diversity promotes knowledge exchange and innovation - Google’s focus on quality physical work environments is cited as an example of this paradox. The benefits of the urban economy are found to trickle beyond the knowledge economy

 and into less skilled aspects of the workforce. Even ‘the precariat’ )characterised by job and social insecurity and a lack of work based identity), exemplified by ‘gig economy’ workers tend to accept lifestyle impacts to remain close to the urban networks

 that provide income. This can be seen to be reflected in recent polling data from UK (EU Exit referendum), though the indications of a longer‐term divide emerging between citizens residing in locations strongly connected to global growth and those who are

 not goes back much further (2005). USA (presidential election) and beyond also show that progressive and inclusive voting tendencies were strongly associated with urban productivity, regardless of socioeconomic status - though youth did have some influence.

 This is thought to represent the cusp of a political transition from materialist to post-materialist values across the generations. There are several potential future implications that may manifest. Urban areas are likely to maintain economic inertia. However

 the cost of living may be a limiting factor which may see urban areas with high graduate concentrations such as Bristol, Manchester and Leeds in the UK become increasingly important economic centres (this could also lead to increased population pressures in

 satellite settlements, as exemplified by the reported youth based ‘renaissance’ of places like Margate and Halifax. In Ireland the economic pressure of high living costs in Dublin have seen 1,000 civil servants (equivalent to 1 in 16) apply for transfers out

 of Dublin in the past 12 months. Political change may come from demographic change. The demographic weight of younger voters, combined with a progressive political agenda could see new political movements emerge with a swell of support for policies that reject

 the neo-liberal agenda of ‘competitiveness and growth for more socially cohesive ideas. The growing economic and political weight of cities may lead to more alliances that bypass national governments in order to promote more progressive agendas, as exemplified

 by the C40 cities and The Carbon Neutral Cities Alliance (%2314489) taking action on climate change. Another writer sees the growing importance of cities leading to a disintegration of national borders. Half the World’s population is already urban, and the economic,

 social and cultural connections we have to urban areas are often far more impactful on our lives than national issues. Political borders often align with economic, social and cultural borders, further highlighting how borders could shift to have more city

 or regional influence. We may therefore have more administrative borders, but with greater freedom of movement between them as cities are more likely to see the value in collaboration. Nations may still have some role in terms over fiscal and military policy.

 There is little mention of the fate of rural areas within these articles. One may conclude that the countryside’s fate is sealed in terms of economic competition, though there are some suggestions that current planning restrictions may be impacting on the

 growth and sustainability of rural communities, further promoting the growth of urban economies. There are implications for resource planning and likely locations of environmental pressures for the Environment Agency. There may also be interest in terms of

 recruitment and attracting new talent. The increasing autonomy of city and regional at a political level may also suggest that the Environment Agency may be able to achieve more of its strategic objectives through local partnering, rather than national level

 water that will need to be used to continually produce these. In addition to this the temperature needed to biodegrade polylactide means that it is unlikely to biodegrade in the average household compost heap. Consequently this does not help with the problem

 of plastic waste persistence. Using alternatives as feedstock such as waste biomass, for example crop residues, could make bioplastics more sustainable. The authors suggest the best policy currently is for governments to promote the use of plastic sparingly

 atmosphere. This can lead to a sense of loss of ownership and control over personal space, and therefore adds to workplace stress and ultimately reduces productivity. For all the research conducted on workplace layouts, there have only been a few studies looking

 at the health implications of open plan offices. These studies suggest that compared to individual offices, open plan offices are not beneficial to employee health, wellbeing and productivity. The short term financial benefits of open plan may be negated by

 increased staff sickness absence, and lower job satisfaction and productivity.

14733,03/12/2018,Jason Dinsdale,"The understanding of the role of diet, both in terms of a cause of, and reaction to, climate change are the subject of recent research.","The implications of this group of studies could relate to the work of the Environment Agency and partners in terms of agricultural regulation, land management and food production and regulation. The link between climate change and the decreasing nutritional

 value of food has been highlighted previously (%2314723, %2310296). Poor nutrition in food due to climate change could cause illness in humans by making food more toxic (%2313996), with similar impacts for wildlife too (%2313743). It is becoming increasingly apparent

 that reducing the amount of meat and dairy in human diets could lead to significant reductions of greenhouse gas emissions. The average EU citizen generates 1,070 kilograms in gas emissions each year, of which 75 % comes from meat and dairy production. Impacts

 are still felt even when import distances are taken into account, meaning that even locally produced meat and dairy are more impactful overall that importing fruits and vegetables. A shift from meat and dairy to fruit and vegetable products – a shift to much

 healthier eating – could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 56% and other environmental pressures by up to 22%. Rising levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere have been found to impact the nutritional value of crops, reducing protein, iron and

 zinc by up to 17% under 2050 expected levels of CO2. This has the potential to lead to zinc, iron and protein deficient diets, the implications of which include wound healing, infections and diarrhoea, stunted growth, and complications in pregnancy and childbirth.

 The impacts are most likely to be experienced in developing countries. Eating more to compensate could lead to other health issues such obesity alongside a decrease in yields from climate change impacts of heat stress and drought. At the same time energy consumption

 from food is increasing due to people getting bigger. Humans have on average grown 1.3 percent taller and 14 percent heavier between 1975 and 2014. The conclusions are based on demographic studies of data from 186 countries. Based on anticipated gains in weight

 and height, the average near-future human will be bigger than their 2018 counterpart and, as a result, will require more food. This could cause additional pressures to the future food supply, which haven’t yet been properly considered, alongside more well

 known factors such as climate change and population growth.",https&%2358;//www.theguardian.com/science/2018/aug/27/climate-change-will-make-hundreds-of-millions-more-people-nutrient-deficient,Climate change will make hundreds of millions more people nutrient deficient,The Guardian,27/08/2018,"Davis, N","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211912418300361?via%3Dihub"">The role of trade in the greenhouse gas footprints of EU diets - Global Food Security 01/12/2018</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/near-future-average-human-projected-be-taller-heavier-leading-increased-food-demand-180970791/"">Soon, the Average Human Will Be Taller, Heavier.

 cryptocurrencies. Future companies may appear more like trust funds that have no owner, just a set of instructions on how to divide company income. The idea of distribution may extend to company employees, who may be scattered across the globe, working with

 colleagues without ever meeting or knowing the true identities of with whom they’re working. Internal politics and decision making chains may have to be written in code rather than ingrained in hierarchy or culture. The hardware that underpins blockchain companies

 may also be distributed. Platforms such as Golem and Filecoin utilise spare server space on their user network’s computers, effectively providing decentralised competition to web hosting services such as Amazon’s AWS. The flexibility of staff, hardware and

 software (through open source code) may present competitive services to more incumbent companies. Such competition may extend beyond computer based services and into other industries, including manufacturing and primary industries such as farming and forestry.

 The latter is exemplified by a art project called terra0. The collaboration between artists and a developer is intended to challenge views on nature and culture. Terra0 is essentially a forest that can autonomously sell it’s trees, accumulating wealth which

 it can eventually use to purchase itself and become a self owned economic unit. Based on blockchain technology activities such as contacting a logging company, or ordering replanting only occurs when certain conditions are met, which could include tree maturity,

 volume (provided by monitoring equipment) and market price are favourable. On completion of purchase the forest essentially gains the ability to own, raising questions on the definition of personhood in legal terms, and is this respect is reminiscent of previous

 initiatives to give elements of nature human rights, such as rivers in India (%2314369) and New Zealand (%2314299). While there are potential advantages of ownerless companies, there are also downsides, such as presenting barriers to accountability (and therefore

 prosecution) and exploitation by criminal activity - the same rules that govern the forest’s protection could be hacked and exploited to encourage premature deforestation, for example. There are however management platforms emerging designed to bring governance

 and digital jurisdiction to blockchain based organisations, (such as Aragon).

Due to &quot;overextended and underfunded&quot; regulation, controlling such sites is problematic. To address this issue,

 Stanford University have designed an algorithm that can catch two to seven times more infractions than current regulation. Using data from previous inspections, the model can predict which sites are likely to fail an inspection based on criteria such as location,

 type of facility and previous performance. Knowing which facilities are likely to fail enables regulators to focus on those sites that are likely to require inspection. It is acknowledged that algorithms are not the 'perfect' solution and can perpetuate bias

 but the researchers can address this using randomised samples and updated risk factors. Whilst this approach is still in its infancy, further work with the EPA could help refine the algorithm and potentially allow better regulation despite a reducing number

14721,15/11/2018,Jason Dinsdale,A new approach to developing antidepressant drugs using CRISPR gene editing technology could work by targeting different neuroreceptors to conventional treatments.,"The Environment Agency should be interested in this development as previous research has demonstrated how trace concentrations of medicines used currently to treat mental health issues can impact on wildlife behaviour (%2315055, %2312213, %2310874, %238932) if not

 removed through wastewater treatment. Most antidepressant drugs target serotonin receptors to boost serotonin chemical levels in the brain, regulating mood and behaviour. Some of the most common drugs for this approach are Prozac, Paxil and Zoloft, to support

 a treatment which has gone unchanged for several decades. The new approach targets delta type GABA receptors with naturally found brain chemicals called neurosteroids that generally help slow down the cognitive processes associated with overwhelming negative

 thoughts and feelings. CRISPR has been used to mutated GABA receptors to isolate and test their role in brain functioning, which has been useful as previously it has been hard to differentiate the different impacts that GABA receptors have on brain function.

 The results of this have led to a study of the impact of natural neurosteroid brexanolone in treating postpartum / postnatal depression. Further studies are needed to explore further how activating delta-type receptors has antidepressant effects, using more

 compounds which in turn could lead to more potent drugs with more more selective impacts and fewer side effects. It is not clear what impacts these new types of drugs could have on wildlife behaviour through water quality, but considering the current intelligence

Carbyne founder Amir Elichai was inspired to set up the company after being mugged on a beach and experiencing

 a delay in getting a response from the emergency services that allowed the assailants plenty of time to flee. He has developed services that focus on ‘time to dispatch’ – the duration from when the call is placed to the moment services are sent to the field.

 Rather than the caller handing over these details Carbyne gives the operator direct access to information on the caller’s smartphone such as position from GPS (they have also developed their own indoor positioning system) and live video streaming which gives

 the operator a much faster appreciation of the situation. If voice is not available then communication is available through instant messaging. Combining these aspects has cut response time by between 60 and 65 per cent. Carbyne have several municipal partners

 around the world and are looking to partner with other location based services such as Waze and Uber, and have an app that people can download to speed up emergency service access. There is often a need for a greater flow of data and information between the

 public and emergency responders during an incident, and services similar to Carbyne could offer a way to harness this potential. it may also prove a useful tool for reporting pollution incidents or breaches of environmental regulation as they happen, giving

 geoengineering schemes involve removing carbon dioxide from the air either mechanically (%2314814) or chemically through mineral absorption, using crushed rock (%2314604). Scientists have recently produced a substance to enhance the natural CO2 absorption that

 occurs during magnesite crystallisation. When magnesite crystallises, it absorbs CO2 at a 2 to 1 ratio&%2358; this means that for every half ton of atmospheric CO2, one ton of magnesite is required. The process normally takes hundreds to thousands of years to occur,

 but with the use of polystyrene microspheres as a catalyst the process could be significantly quickened to around 72 days. The polystyrene microspheres can be reused, streamlining the process and putting less strain on magnesite resources.",https&%2358;//www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/08/solar-geo-engineering-cant-save-the-worlds-crops/567017/,A disappointing new problem with geo-engineering,Error - action required,08/08/2018,"Meyer, R","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//interestingengineering.com/scientists-produce-mineral-in-lab-that-can-remove-co2-from-the-atmosphere"">Scientists produce mineral in lab that can remove CO2 from the atmosphere - Interesting Engineering 16/08/2018</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0417-3.epdf"">Estimating global agricultural effects of geoengineering using volcanic eruptions - Nature 02/11/2018</a></p>",Error - action required,,,Error - action required,,DFOS,4 - signficant development needed,DFOS,geoengineering &quot;climate change&quot; pollution air sulphate energy pollutant farming photosynthesis plant sunlight regulation crop rock &quot;carbon dioxide&quot; CO2 magnesite catalyst polystyrene microsphere crystalise,No,Yes,No,No,No,,"geoengineering, pollution, climate change, regulation",,,,[],18/05/2022 11:45,"Loveday, Tim",17/05/2021 11:59,"Loveday, Tim",0,,"15,089",,,Jason Dinsdale

 to ensure that internet service providers treated all users equally, prohibiting blocking of certain services, slowing down particular websites, or charging more to access them. Last December the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) voted to end net neutrality,

 despite vehement opposition and threats of legal action. This paves the way for service providers to tailor access to favour particular companies, organisations or doctrines to the detriment of other users. Today the internet is now a fundamental tool in emergency

 response. Recently the Santa Clara County Fire Department claims to have experienced a ‘throttling’ of its internet services from its provider Verizon, despite paying for ‘unlimited’ data. This impacted on the performance of a command and control vehicle attending

 a major emergency. Verizon confirmed the throttling, but rather than restore the normal service they indicated that the Department would have to upgrade to a more expensive data plan. Verizon have since apologised and agreed to remove the throttling. But Santa

14707,30/10/2018,Jason Dinsdale,A new branch of chemistry promises a future where organic matter such as sugar could be converted into jet fuel using nothing but light.,"The Environment Agency and partners should be interested to consider how a sustainable method for producing combustion fuel like this could impact on other transport and energy strategies, policies and regulations, especially around agriculture and air

 pollution. The aim of Bioinspired Light-Escalated Chemistry (BioLEC) is to investigate how to use the energy of two photons, the tiniest quantifiable units of light, to power chemical reactions. In theory an organic plant based molecule such as a sugar or

 alcohol that contains a chain of carbon atoms connected to an oxygen and hydrogen atom could be converted to jet fuel, but the carbon-carbon bond is extremely difficult to break. However targeting the carbon chain with a photon would weaken the bond, while

 introducing a second photon could break the chain completely, making is much easier to discard the oxygen and reassemble the carbon and hydrogen atoms to make a jet fuel. Scientists are currently investigating using catalysts exposed to a very particular amount

 of light in order to break the bonds through using a technique called pulse radiolysis that concentrates a beam of electrons at molecules. The resulting reactions can give scientists a better idea on how to harness the power of BioLEC to produce fuel from

 organic matter. Enabling the chemistry that could manufacture jet fuel from abundant natural materials would lead to a cheap, plentiful source of clean energy. It could also be adapted to break down the byproducts and other waste of industrial plants, and

 possibly convert these to other abundant and inexpensive biodegradable compounds or even fuels. However, the process would still produce carbon emissions from combustion of the fuels, so would have to be considered in a sustainable life cycle context in order

 to offer a clean alternative to conventional fossil fuels.",https&%2358;//futurism.com/biolec-new-chemistry/,"Sugar, light, and a new type of chemistry - what it may take to wean us off fossil fuels",Futurism,21/08/2018,"Robitzski, D",&%23160;,Error - action required,,,Error - action required,,DFOS,4 - signficant development needed,DFOS,energy chemistry fuel &quot;fossil fuel&quot;  &quot;jet fuel&quot; regulation &quot;Bioinspired Light-Escalated Chemistry&quot; BioLEC carbon oxygen hydrogen atom catalyst photon jet fuel &quot;pulse radiolysis&quot; electron research sugar alcohol organic waste &quot;water quality&quot; industry pollution pollutant &quot;water treatment&quot; biodegradable,No,Yes,No,No,No,,"energy, chemistry, regulation",,,,[],18/05/2022 11:45,"Loveday, Tim",17/05/2021 11:59,"Loveday, Tim",0,,"15,084",,,Jason Dinsdale

14705,30/10/2018,Jason Dinsdale,As the technology industry starts to consider the ethical implications of artificial intelligence (AI) some commentators are looking at the geopolitical implications of AI technology,"AI guru Kai-Fu Lee sees the future of AI technologies being dominated by two countries&%2358; the USA and China. Both countries lead the World in terms of numbers of AI and machine related patents filed. China is likely to develop the best technology for two

 reasons. Firstly China has tended to display what could be simplistically termed a ‘copycat culture’ of developing and testing multiple product iterations in a live environment, which pushes risk and innovation. Secondly there is a ‘data gap’ between the USA

 and China, the latter having unprecedented amount of digital data available about its citizens, enabling services to be more precisely tailored to individual needs. Another difference is that USA technology is delivered via a platform model eg through Facebook,

 Apple or Google, whereas China’s approach is to use their technology to support local partners. Alphabet chaiman and Google founder Eric Schmidt now refers to the latter as an &quot;AI company&quot; and no longer a data company, for example. Whilst Europe most resembles

 the platform model concerns about data privacy may hinder AI development for commercial purposes and instead reposition AI development for social purposes, such as healthcare. The concern for data protection can be seen from the recent General Data Protection

 Regulation (GDPR) laws, which Apple’s CEO Tim Cook has recently suggested need to be similarly adopted by the US to prevent the ‘weaponisation’ of personal data by commercial interests. Note that many US websites have chosen to block European visitors rather

 than have to comply with GDPR, perhaps illustrating the different regional and cultural attitudes to personal data collection and how this could splinter the internet as we know it. The consequence of these differences may manifest globally as three internet

 systems&%2358; USA &amp; Australasia; China and southern Asia; and Europe. Tim Berners Lee’s concept of a decentralised internet (%2315078) may help to allay European data concerns. Lee also acknowledges the negative impacts that AI could bring to the global jobs market,

 though some commentators disagree with the scale of impact. One of the strengths of China in the AI arms race, according to <a href=""https&%2358;//interestingengineering.com/author/john-loeffler"" rel=""author"">John Loeffl</a>er, is that it doesn't have the kind of established industries that could be greatly impacted by AI, unlike Europe which relies heavily on the financial sector for

 example and therefore may show reluctance to embrace AI. The current politic climate surrounding immigration in the USA and Europe may also make it comparatively easier for China to recruit talent. While Kai-Fu Lee (in this article) sees AI through a social

 and commercial lense, another commentator considers the implications of AI development on the wider issue of national security and resilience. Tech entrepreneur Ian Hogarth compares AI development to the nuclear arms race, where there is a technology with

 the potential for the greater good, or for mass destruction. In order to remain economically competitive and defend themselves from hostile entities nations may have to invest significantly in AI development on a scale that could compare with other national

 priorities including military hardware and climate change adaptation. Despite having a disproportionately high concentration of AI talent in the UK, such as the Google backed start-up DeepMind, Hogarth sees risk in a lack of strategic direction from both government

 and opposition who are distracted by more short term cost considerations such as EU Exit and nationalisation of the railways. AI could impact on the Environment Agency and partners in many ways operationally, such as making the current workforce more efficient

 and reducing costs. However from a geopolitical standpoint, superior AI in the hands of hostile agencies may represent a threat to IT systems and infrastructure which is becoming increasingly ‘smart’. AI may also represent competition to other government strategic

 priorities which may include climate change adaptation or agricultural sustainability.",https&%2358;//www.washingtonpost.com/news/theworldpost/wp/2018/09/24/artificial-intelligence-2,The great AI duopoly,Error - action required,24/09/2018,"Gardels, N","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//interestingengineering.com/will-chinas-ai-industry-win-humanitys-final-arms-race"">Will China's AI industry win humanity's final arms race? - Interesting Engineering 27/02/2019</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-45963935"">Tim Cook blasts 'weaponisation' of personal data and praises GDPR - BBC 24/10/2018</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//theconversation.com/worried-about-ai-taking-over-the-world-you-may-be-making-some-rather-unscientific-assumptions-103561"">Worried about AI taking over the world?

14701,26/10/2018,Jason Dinsdale,Tim Berners Lee is spearheading a movement to ‘turbocharge’ the emergence of a decentralised internet that could challenge the current systems and take control from corporations and give it to individuals.,"A decentralised internet, also referred to as ‘Internet 3.0’ (%2314269) envisages an internet where people have full control of their data and the web itself remains free and open. Technologies such as distributed ledgers, blockchain and dApps (distributed

 applications) are some of the concepts and technologies that could contribute to this move. Berners Lee is now on a one year sabbatical to work on Inrupt, the first start-up built of a decentralised web platform called Solid that he’s been developing with

 MIT. The power of Solid is demonstrated by an app that collects together lots of web applications, such as Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Facebook owned WhatsApp. The difference to other platforms is that all the personal data is held in a Solid pod (personalised

 online data store) and not with the service provider. Another development in the pipeline is an Alexa like personal assistant called Charlie, but where users have control of the data they submit. Other tools will be made available via Inrupt to help developers

 build more decentralised applications, and Berners Lee is seeking venture capital to continue growing his development team. Solid and Inrupt aren’t the only developers in the decentralised and distributed web space. Another example is Japanese company LINE

 that is developing a range of blockchain based dApps that are working towards flattening the relationship between developer and user, and also uses its own token system for both payment and reward in using its services, whilst protecting personal data. The

 rise of a decentralised internet as envisioned by Berners Lee and others is that these services represent direct competition and threat to the current platform providers that generate their wealth from user data such as Facebook and Google. This has recently

 been brought into focus by the Facebook / Cambridge Analytica scandal, demonstrating how personal data can be used to for unintended purposes. This also means that third parties that use their data for communications, advertising and marketing purposes may

 also be compromised, as may intelligence services, without significant changes to business models or legislations. Some manufacturers are already gearing up hardware in preparation for a decentralised internet, such as HTC's blockchain powered smartphone (%2314770).

14699,22/10/2018,Jason Dinsdale,Clothing rental may be emerging as a contender to clothing ownership.,"This growing trend and example of the sharing economy has environmental implications due to the large resource footprint of clothing production and may also impact on the Environment Agency regulated industries of waste and textile production. Whilst renting

 clothes such as tuxedos and wedding dresses is not a new concept, the idea of more every day clothes being provided via a rental service is reasonably novel. It has been calculated that doubling the number of times a garment is worn decrease its environmental

 footprint by 44%. Companies such as Rent The Runway have been offering the online based service since 2009. Another company called YCloset based in China has grown to 10 million registered customers recently, mainly women, though not all have used the service

 yet. Both companies are moving to a subscription service for every day clothes rather than a one off payment for special occasion garments. YCloset’s recent social media campaign involving social media influencer Jiang Chacha was designed to allay customer

 concerns about cleanliness, preparing the clothing rental subscription service to go mainstream. The service gives customers access to higher quality and designer items, and one CEO suggests that people may eventually spend half of their clothes budgets on

 renting rather than buying. A similar baby clothes rental business was set up (%2314364) to address the relatively few times that baby clothes are worn due to growth, but price may have been a factor in widespread adoption. There are also suggestions that new

 materials could lead to self healing clothes, reducing the need for replacement and consequent waste management issues around landfill, though this development is perhaps further in the future (%2314084). The current surge in interest could therefore make clothing

 rental more mainstream, reducing environmental impacts of textile production, reducing waste and moving to a more circular economy.",https&%2358;//www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-45630395,Will we soon be renting rather than buying our clothes?,BBC,26/09/2018,"Hooker, L",&%23160;,Error - action required,,,Error - action required,,DFOS,2 - near to realisation,DFOS,&quot;sharing economy&quot; &quot;circular economy&quot; waste landfill clothes clothing textile &quot;social media&quot; &quot;environmental impact&quot; resources baby consumer purchase subscribe subscription service fashion designer water energy land farming agriculture cotton &quot;Rent The Runway&quot; YCloset subscription rent online women influencer &quot;Jiang Chacha&quot; China USA regulation,No,Yes,No,No,No,,"waste, textiles, circular economy",,,,[],18/05/2022 11:45,"Loveday, Tim",17/05/2021 11:59,"Loveday, Tim",0,,"15,076",,,Jason Dinsdale
14698,19/10/2018,Jason Dinsdale,Replacements for BPA in plastics may also have negative health impacts.,"The Environment Agency and partners should have an interest in the health and environmental impacts of chemicals that may experience widespread use. Evidence on the endocrine disrupting properties of bisphenol(A) (BPA) have led to legislative steps to remove

 its use, mainly from plastics and packaging. Similar compounds to BPA from the same family such as BPS, BPF and BHPF are being used as replacements, but evidence of similar impacts (%2314305, %2314277, %2313012) could suggest that they too may face restrictions

 in use in the future. But another study has found that another BPA replacement may not be safe. In 2003 researchers found that BPA was leaching from laboratory mice cages, increasing chromosomal abnormalities in females and their offspring. The impacts have

 been seen across generations of mice, even when the offspring have no exposure to BPA. In more recent studies the researchers have observed similar results, even though the plastic cages are BPA free. It was found that the mice were chewing the cages, leading

 to their BPA alternative diphenyl sulfone being leached out. They believe that polysulfone degrades into BPS, causing the abnormalities, and may be causing similar impacts to all animals that are exposed to it, including humans, though there is currently not

 the research to establish any impact. The results also raise concerns about the reliability of BPA research as this impact of sulfone may have unwittingly influenced results.",https&%2358;//www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/09/bpa-substitutes-may-be-just-bad-popular-consumer-plastic?rss=1,BPA substitutes may be just as bad as the popular consumer plastic,Science,13/09/2018,"Service, R.

 have ‘Spacebook’, a global internet online in 5-7 years, space arks in 15 years and a permanent settlement on the Moon in 25 years. Ashurbeyli seems well aware of the technological and environmental challenges that forming a space nation present. However 200,000

A boom in ketamine use has been identified in the United

 States. Ketamine, most commonly used as a veterinary tranquiliser has also been misappropriated for recreational use. The current boom in the USA however is related to medical use for treating mental health conditions, migraines and as a painkiller. Ketamine

 clinics have sprung up across the country in recent years, offering patients treatment courses of proprietary blends.There are concerns about the effectiveness of ketamine treatments, alongside worries of proper patient screening and inadequately qualified

 staff. The internet has also helped to spread the popularity of medicinal ketamine, regardless of evidence of effectiveness. Much like ketamine there is some intelligence to suggest that people are turning to psychedelics such as MDMA and hallucinogenic psilocybin

 mushrooms for use in alternative therapies, employing 'LSD guides' to help them through the healing process and deal with mental health issues. Unlike psychotherapists, however, underground guides have no accredited educational institutions, no licensing.

 In the UK there are some reports that a small but increasing number of women are 'microdosing' (%2313654) magic mushrooms and LSD to enhance energy levels, alertness and allowing them to play with their children in a more fulfilling way, with the suggestion

 that microdosing may be 'going mainstream'. Back in the States academics are calling for psilocybin mushrooms, so called ‘magic mushrooms’ to be reclassified, as the evidence suggests that it is not open to high abuse and may have medicinal uses in treating

 some mental health conditions, such as alleviating their end-of-life anxiety and depression. Researchers have had success using medicinal magic mushrooms in controlled settings, where the dose is regulated and administered by a trained clinician, a psychologist

 or trained therapist guides the recipient through the experience, and there’s very specific goals for the therapy. It is unclear if psilocybin has the environmental persistence of other substances, yet still represents a trend in a growing interest in using

 within the furnace. Oxides within the furnace act as solvents, dissolving iron oxide. The freed oxygen ions rise to the top of the furnace, whilst the molten metal drains to the bottom. Ingredients such as carbon, needed to give steel strength, can be added

 as the metal cools. The process is still at the small scale experimental stage, but plans are ahead to increase production capacity. Should this become realised, along with a willingness in the industry to change tried and tested practices, switching to the

14689,17/10/2018,Jason Dinsdale,Silicon Valley start-ups are increasingly turning their attention to the waste industry.,"Considering the disruption that the sector has brought to all aspects of life, the Environment Agency and partners may need to consider how some of the products and services being developed may come to impact on waste management.

 to an increase in waste include&%2358; the rising value of the waste removal and disposal sector; increasing populations producing more waste; the increased profile of the environment, sustainability and the circular economy in public consciousness; and improved

 logistics that offer a constant stream of raw materials. The science underpinning a lot of developments however is not particularly new. There are significant developments across the waste-to-fuel and waste-to-product industries, in the form of thermal (pyrolysis,

 hydrothermal, gasification) and non-thermal technologies. Companies are targeting a variety of waste types, including household waste, (plastics and organics), as well as agricultural waste (like wood) and livestock waste (like manure). Waste is then converted

 into products, including synthetic crude oil, natural gas, electricity, refined products (from diesel to high-value waxes) and specialty chemicals. Challenges still remain around securing financial backing, fluctuating waste prices and upscaling new developments.

 However support for these technologies and processes are accelerating, as due to the local and regional nature of these projects, it is unlikely for global forces to derail progress - an example given is China aggressively entering the market and undercutting

 prices as they did with solar a decade ago.",https&%2358;//techcrunch.com/2018/07/05/bioproducts-are-seeing-major-tailwinds-in-renewable-tech/,Bioproducts are seeing major tailwinds in renewable tech,Error - action required,17/07/2018,"Dickson, T & Brentan Alexander, B",&%23160;,Error - action required,,,Error - action required,,DFOS,3 - some development needed,DFOS,waste &quot;Silicon Valley&quot; investment startup fuel energy wood manure diesel technology USA California economics China solar sustainability &quot;circular economy&quot; population regulation,No,Yes,No,No,No,,"waste, innovation, investment",,,,[],18/05/2022 11:45,"Loveday, Tim",17/05/2021 11:59,"Loveday, Tim",0,,"15,066",,,Jason Dinsdale

Bitnation is a blockchain powered government service platform that

 believes virtual governments could replace nation states by offering decentralized public services and globalized identities. It was founded by Susanne Tarkowski Tempelhof. Bitnation currently has around 180 volunteer run embassies in the physical world, and

 a global membership of 5,3000 mainly concentrated in Europe. Bitnation already offers people, amongst other things, citizenship of a virtual nation state. Other services include marriages (including the world’s first Blockchain Marriage), blockchain land titles

 and birth certificates. There is also a Bitnation cryptocurrency that functions as a proof-of-reputation for Bitnation citizens, allowing them to use smart contracts, paving the way for legal transactions and business regulations beyond traditional nation

 states. Bitnation has also provided refugee emergency digital ID cards and Bitcoin Visa cards, for which it was awarded a UNESCO prize for Bitnation Refugee Emergency Response (BRER). Bitnation may find that its largest potential markets are in countries with

 less political freedoms than in Europe. However one of the founders sees the potential in replacing, rather than improving nation states, freeing people from being ‘prisoners of geography’ when it comes to choosing governments and services. Bitnation is gaining

Analysis Nesta,

 based on looking at 41 million job adverts revealed that non-digitally intensive occupations such as teachers and chefs, could grow in the future whereas digitally intensive occupations may shrink. At the same time digital skills used in non-routine tasks,

 problem solving and digital outputs may also be in demand. Nesta’s top five promising digital skills include&%2358; animation; multimedia production; design in engineering; building and maintaining IT systems and networks; and research and quantitative data analysis.

 The least promising digital skills include&%2358; invoice processing and management of accounts using accounting software; data input and preparation of payroll and tax reports; clerical duties (e.g. typing, using a word processor, spreadsheets, email and calendar

 software); sales support and processing of orders in sales management systems; and stock and inventory management using inventory control systems. There are also signs that arts disciplines such as philosophy, English and languages may become in greater demand

 than science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM). McKinsey analysis of future skills has (amongst others) predicted that demand for arts-associated skills such as creativity, empathy, adaptability and entrepreneurship will grow at a faster rate to 2030

 than demand for skills in technology engineering data analysis, and research and development. STEAM with the A for ‘Arts’ is therefore gaining traction as a term within industry. As the power of automation grows (as exemplified by IBM’s AI that beat a human

 of Toledo has discovered how blue light causes this damage. Retinal is a key molecule involved in vision, and is responsible for converting light energy into electrical signals in the brain. In the lab, the researchers combined retinal with a variety of different

 cells from the body, including neurons, photoreceptor cells and heart cells. When the samples were exposed to blue light, the retinal molecules produced poisonous chemicals which killed the neighboring cells. Neither the blue light or retinal alone was responsible

 for the cell damage.",https&%2358;//futurism.com/blue-light-blindness-retinal/,Scientists knew blue light from screens contributed to blindness. now they know why.,Futurism,10/08/2018,Kristen Hauser,&%23160;,Error - action required,,,Error - action required,,DFOS,3 - some development needed,DFOS,Blue light retinal eye damage digital devices screens ,No,Yes,No,No,No,,Blue light and blindness,,,,[],18/05/2022 11:45,"Loveday, Tim",17/05/2021 11:57,"Loveday, Tim",0,,"14,939",,,lchristie

Unlike most medicines, they are small enough to pass from the bloodstream in to the brain. Parkinson's disease is thought to be

 caused by a protein called synuclein folding into the wrong shape. This triggers a chain reaction of misfolding in nearby synuclein molecules, and causes a build up of long strands of the protein known as 'fibrils' which can kill neurons. Researchers in China

 recently found that in a dish, quantum dots made from graphene can bind to synuclein, stopping it from forming new fibrils. When tested in mice dosed with fibrils, quantum dots were found to minimise effects of the fibrils, which normally trigger movement

 problems.

 the land changes, 60% are associated with direct human activities and 40% with indirect drivers such as climate change, with montane systems have gained tree cover and many arid and semi-arid ecosystems have lost vegetation cover across all climate domains.

14525,08/08/2018,Jason Dinsdale,Developments in e-waste mining have demonstrated that it could be significantly more profitable compared to virgin metal extraction.,"The Environment Agency as a waste regulator may have to adapt policies and procedures in light of this to enable waste mining to develop as an industry. A recent study found that extracting metals from recycled electronics is as cost effective as mining

 for virgin material - up to 13 times cheaper if one were to account for subsidies as offered in China. An experimental urban mine in Australia has automated separation of WEEE and can recover metals via a furnace. The set up costs of £280,000 for a microfactory

 could probably pay themselves off within three years. Devices are sorted by a robot, and the plastics from circuit boards are recovered as a high end 3D printing filament. And an EU project is making it easier for companies to track materials available in

 scrap devices to help target more effective recovery initiatives. As China closes its borders to e-waste for recycling and a growing interest in the circular economy, urban mining on a small scale may grow more prevalent. The decentralisation of this activity

 may therefore require a regulatory response from the Environment Agency that allows for a greater number of operators whilst still limiting the potential environmental damage of handling some of the substances in question, alongside any associated emissions

 and wastes.",https&%2358;//www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-44642176,E-waste mining could be big business - and good for the planet,BBC,06/07/2018,"Wollacott, E",&%23160;,Error - action required,,,Error - action required,,DFOS,2 - near to realisation,DFOS,waste resources &quot;circular economy&quot; China electronics electrical digital WEEE microfactory decentralisation &quot;3D printing&quot; robot Australia microfactory &quot;urban mine&quot; metal element mineral emission regulation,No,Yes,No,No,No,,"resources, decentralisation, regulation ",,,,[],18/05/2022 11:44,"Loveday, Tim",17/05/2021 11:57,"Loveday, Tim",0,,"14,902",,,Jason Dinsdale

An analysis of previous cases found that in 16 per cent of cases

 where actions was taken it was due to health impacts. As stronger links are made between air pollution (from combustion, including power stations) and health, this will also strengthen the links between climate change and human health. This link between health

 concerns air pollution and climate change could mean that emerging litigation cases could lead to more effective climate policy-making. As air quality moves up the agenda, it may become a significant lever in climate related legal action, impacting on Environment

 thus so do their medicinal properties. This has led to Belfast University creating a partnership with a livestock organisation to investigate the potential of using cold plasma treatments in agriculture, to try and reduce the need for antibiotics and other

 chemicals in the food chain.

14493,03/08/2018,Jason Dinsdale,"Climate change, and the strategies people take to mitigate its effects, may be starting to reshape the socioeconomic landscapes of urban areas - a phenomena called ‘climate gentrification’.","Environment Agency and partners may need to consider how activities around flood defence may contribute to climate gentrification, particularly in coastal areas.   Climate gentrification is described as climate change impacts making property more or less valuable, creating patterns of urban development that lead to displacement or entrenchment of existing populations as seen within conventional framings of gentrification.

 In a study of property prices in Miami, Florida, a city considered to be under the greatest threat from climate change and sea level rise, properties with a higher elevation were found to have experienced rising prices, whilst those at the lowest elevations

 experienced the reverse. Lower elevation properties were also found to have appreciated at a lower rate compared to those at higher elevations, attributed to ‘nuisance flooding’. Exposure to inland water bodies also had a similar influence in property value.

 Three pathways to climate gentrification were identified. The first is investors moving capital to properties with greater elevation. The second is where climate changes raises the cost of living so that only the wealthiest can remain in a location. The third

 pathway is where the environment is re-engineered to be more climate resilient, called a “resilience investment pathway.” One example could be people moving to an area with better flood protection and hard defences, as seems to have happened in Copenhagen,

 forcing less advantaged, lower-income households out of certain neighbourhoods.

Later in 2018 Google are planning to map air quality in London using two StreetView cars equipped with sensors

 from a different company, AirMaps, that record air quality every 30 metres, along with 100 fixed point sensors. London mayor Sadiq Khan is calling it “the most sophisticated (network) in the World”. The hyperlocal data generated over the next year will be

 used to inform policy responses to London air quality, and shared with other members of the C40 Cities network. Aclima have also scaling up their air quality monitoring efforts, attracting a large investment in its air quality sensor and mapping network, having

 recently completed a hyperlocal air quality monitoring project (with Google, amongst others) in Austin, Texas, employing a similar method to Google’s London project. This has produced one of the most detailed urban air quality data sets ever. Fixed monitoring

 network is designed for air quality regulation, don’t always indicate air pollution to people in their immediate surroundings. Highly-localised emissions data is also quite limited, and models have to be used to fill the gaps using limited data. The platforms

 that Google and Aclima are using complements existing stationary monitoring by introducing air pollution data at street level, and may even surpass it in the future, particularly as data gathered by citizen scientists (%2314465) through their personal devices

 (%2313622, %2313145) grow in number. Google has also started estimating greenhouse gas emissions for individual cities to help local administrations take action on climate change. Estimates are based on carbon emissions from electricity and transportation data,

 including information collected by its popular mapping apps, Google Maps and Waze. More accurate estimates including heavy industry and agriculture are currently hampered by the age and quality of data. So far Google has estimates for five cities but plans

 to cover municipalities worldwide. Commercial companies have different motivations compared to the public sector. Whilst there is potential for partnership there is also potential for competition in giving an authoritative position on air pollution, plus the

 potential to challenge official views of pollution and emissions from regulated sectors. Regulators in this field, including the Environment Agency may need to consider how future regulatory activities may develop with commercial parties also involved, potentially

 providing a better and more detailed environmental monitoring service.",https&%2358;//techcrunch.com/2018/06/26/aclima-sucks-in-24m-to-scale-its-air-quality-mapping-platform/,Aclima sucks in $24M to scale its air quality mapping platform,Error - action required,26/06/2018,"Lomas, N","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//techcrunch.com/2018/06/21/google-streetview-cars-to-help-map-pollution-in-london/"">Google StreetView cars to help map pollution in London - TechCrunch 21/06/2018</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/09/google-climate-change-greenhouse-gas-emissions/571144/"">Google's new tool to fight climate change - The Atlantic 25/09/2018</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//aclima.io/press/google-aclima-edf-and-ut-austin-announce-results-of-breakthrough-study-mapping-air-quality/"">Google, Aclima, Environmental Defense Fund, and UT Austin announce results of breakthrough study mapping hyperlocal air quality - Aclima 05/06/2017</a></p>",Error - action required,,,Error - action required,,DFOS,1 - realised,DFOS,&quot;air quality&quot; &quot;environmental monitoring&quot; &quot;air pollution&quot; pollution Google Aclima sensor Streetview hyperlocal data regulation commercial street level urban city neighbourhood C40 cities policy London Austin Texas car vehicle modelling monitoring network &quot;citizen science&quot; smartphone mobile phone &quot;climate change&quot; Map Waze &quot;greenhouse gas&quot; emission,No,Yes,No,No,No,,"air quality, data, regulation",,,,[],18/05/2022 11:44,"Loveday, Tim",17/05/2021 11:56,"Loveday, Tim",0,,"14,849",,,Jason Dinsdale

14461,19/07/2018,lharriss,Speech given by the UK Attorney General setting out the UK's position on applying international law to cyberspace.,"The Government set out it's view that&%2358; * International law does apply to cyber space and the question is how it applies; * States that are targeted by hostile cyber operations have the right to respond to in accordance with the options lawfully available

 to them. The UK has been working with other states to progress multilateral agreement on what responsible state behaviour in cyberspace looks like. In 2013, the UN Group of Governmental Experts on the use of cyber technologies, affirmed the application of

 existing international law to states’ cyber activities. In 2015, the UN Expert Group (including the UK, US, Russia &amp; China) recognised that the UN Charter applies to cyberspace. The Group affirmed the relevance of a state’s inherent right to act in self-defence

 in response to a cyber operation meeting the threshold of an armed attack. It also confirmed that the fundamental protections of international humanitarian law&%2358; necessity, proportionality, humanity and distinction, apply in cyberspace. There are some areas

 in which UK Gov opinion varies from international law. E.g. It argues that a state should not be legally obliged to give prior notification to a hostile state before taking countermeasures against it. It also argues that there is no requirement for a response

 to be symmetrical to the underlying unlawful act. What matters is necessity and proportionality, which means that the UK could respond to a cyber intrusion through non-cyber means, and vice versa. The Gov also highlighted the challenge of accurately attributing

 a cyber attack when the action concerned is capable of crossing traditional territorial boundaries and sophisticated techniques are used to hide the identity and source of the operation. Those difficulties are compounded by the ready accessibility of cyber

 technologies and the resultant blurring of lines between the actions of governments and those of individuals. It has started to publically attribute attacks to state actors in some cases (e.g. WannaCry to North Korea and NotPetya to Russia) and says that it's

 important to publically scrutinise adversaries to encourage them to behave more responsibly.

14431,11/07/2018,jwentworth,Emissions of CO2 and methane from wetlands and thawing permafrost as the climate warms could cut the “carbon budget” for the Paris Agreement temperature limits by around five years.,"Global methane emissions from natural wetlands and carbon release from permafrost thaw have a positive feedback on climate, yet are not represented in most state-of-the-art climate models. Furthermore, a fraction of the thawed permafrost carbon is released

 as methane, enhancing the combined feedback strength. This study focuses on two processes on the land surface&%2358; thawing permafrost and natural wetlands.These are both positive feedbacks for the climate because, as they respond to rising temperatures, they cause

 the release of more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Permafrost is the name given to soil that has been frozen for at least two years. It is predominantly found in the northern hemisphere – stretching across northern reaches of Russia, Canada and Alaska.

 These soils hold a huge amount of carbon, accumulated from dead plants and animals over thousands of years. The researchers used a “multi-layered soil carbon model” called JULES (Joint UK Land Environment Simulator), which has an improved representation of

 soil chemistry and the way that wetlands create methane. To estimate carbon budgets, the researchers use an “inverted” form of the model. This means, rather than plugging in pathways of future greenhouse gas emissions and seeing how global temperatures respond,

 the researchers input pathways of global temperature rise and use the model to estimate the corresponding levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The study looks at three scenarios of future global warming&%2358; holding temperature rise at 1.5°C and 2°C,

 and one where warming “overshoots” 1.5°C, reaches 1.75°C, then returns to 1.5°C. When the additional CO2 and methane emissions are incorporated, the available carbon budget shrinks substantially – falling to 533bn-753bn tonnes of CO2 for 1.5°C, or 14-20 years of emissions. The extra carbon released from thawing permafrost and warming wetlands would continue beyond the date of net-zero emissions and this would need to be countered for in order to consider carbon budgets applicable for 2100

 climatically suitable range for each species under different levels of warming, taking into account the ability of species to disperse to more favorable locations as the climate shifts. If countries meet their current pledges under the Paris Agreement and

 make no further emissions cuts, this is likely to lead to about 3.2 °C of warming (compared to pre-industrial temperatures) by the year 2100. Under 3.2 °C of warming, 49% of insects, 44% of plants, and 26% of vertebrate species would lose half their geographic

 range. If, instead, the nations of the world meet the overall goal of the Paris Agreement and hold warming to 2 °C then 18% of insects, 16% of plants, and 8% of vertebrate species will see their ranges shrink by half. Overall, insects are exposed to greater

 potential climatic range loss than any other animal group, and also benefit the most if warming is constrained to 1.5 °C rather than 2 °C. The half-degree difference between 2 °C and 1.5 °C of warming halves the risk to plants and vertebrates, and cuts the

 risk to insects by two-thirds. However, analysis is likely to underplay the risks to biodiversity, because it does not take into account how interactions between species could be disrupted by climate change, nor the effects of extreme weather events and fires

 that are projected to become more frequent and intense as the planet warms. In addition, a lot of scenarios for aggressive climate change mitigation call for bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, or BECCS, which involves growing trees or other biofuel

 to get a full picture of trade-offs and we therefore lack sufficient evidence for whether and how agricultural intensification can contribute to sustaining human well being and ecosystem services. For example, the study of well being was in most cases limited

 to household cleaning products which dissolve and free the chains minerals in the clay content of the soil such aluminium, silicon, alkali metal. The resulting clay like material can be moulded and fired at around 100 degrees celsius. The process can be adjusted

 to account for varying soil content. GSSM would be a suitable replacement for concrete in low and mid rise housing, saving valuable concrete resources for more appropriate applications. It is hoped that alternatives to the household like chemicals involved

Iron deficiency can lead to, among other things,

 anemia and zinc deficiency to a compromised immune system. Rice biofortification is therefore a sustainable approach to improving the health of the affected populations globally. Most of the commercially-bred rice varieties contain only around two μg/g iron

 in the endosperm. This explains why micronutrient deficiencies are common in countries where rice provides a major share of the daily calories. This study genetically modified one of the most commonly grown varieties of rice. The advantage over the original

 variety is that these plants are better at mobilising their cellular stores of zinc and iron and depositing in the white part of the rice grain (known as endosperm). This means that the micronutrients are transported and concentrate there. The ETH researchers

 are the first to explore this aspect of cellular transport mechanisms of iron and zinc to enrich rice with micronutrients. To achieve this enrichment, Bhullar and her team incorporated a genetic construct expressing a combination of three additional genes

 into the rice plants. One of these genes facilitates mobilisation of iron stored in the plant vacuoles, another encodes for an iron-storing protein Ferritin, and the third promotes efficient iron and zinc uptake by the roots. As recommended by the Consultative

 Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), 15 μg/g dry weight (DW) iron and 28 μg/g DW zinc in polished grains are required to provide 30% of the dietary estimated average requirement (EAR). The GM rice lines have iron increases equaling more than

They come from a wide range of materials including tiny plastic beads found in health and beauty products, plastic fibres from clothing and plastic flakes that break down from

 packaging. This study measured microplastics (MPs) up- and downstream of six wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in different catchments with varying characteristics and found that all led to an increase in MPs in rivers. Nevertheless, the data collected indicated

 that there were other important sources of MPs in the catchments studied and that these may include atmospheric deposition, agricultural land to which sewage sludge has been applied, and diffuse release of secondary MPs following the breakdown of larger plastic

 items. MPs were comprised mainly of fibres, fragments, and flakes with pellets and beads only dominating at one site. Variation in MP pollution occurred over time and this difference was greater at some sites than others. Microplastics are one of the least

 studied groups of contaminants in river systems.

These services largely depend on the highly complex three-dimensional structure of coral reefs. For coral reefs to thrive, calcifying

 organisms, such as corals, must build the reef faster than bioeroding organisms and natural dissolution break the reef down. However, little is known about how the two stressors of nutrient pollution and acidification interact and influence coral reef ecosystem

 functioning. In nutrient polluted seawater, calcifiers were shown to be less able to capitalize on the dissolved compounds that make up the building blocks of coral reefs. Nutrient pollution reduced calcification rates—a measure of how quickly reef builders

 are creating the skeletal framework—nearly tenfold in waters that would otherwise promote reef growth, and enhanced both skeletal dissolution and the growth of seaweed competitors. This laboratory based research suggests the nutrients change the local pH environment

 by compromising how corals and other reef organisms breathe, which influences the chemistry of the reef and can make the whole system more susceptible to global threats such as ocean acidification.",http&%2358;//rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/285/1880/20172718,Nutrient pollution disrupts key ecosystem functions on coral reefs,Proceedings of the Royal Society B,06/06/2018,"Nyssa J.

Lignin shares some structural and materials property similarities with petroleum-derived

 polymers, such as polystyrene and polymethyl methacrylate, which are commonly used in adhesives and other consumer products, from packaging materials to cups. Using a commercially available catalyst material, the researchers developed a mild, low-temperature

 depolymerisation process to create monomers from lignin. This was followed by followed by minimal purification steps (filtration and extraction) to produce two aromatic compounds, 4-propylsyringol and 4-propylguaiacol, with high purity and yield. Efficient

 functionalization of those aromatic compounds with either acrylate or methacrylate groups generated monomers that could be easily polymerized by a scalable reversible addition–fragmentation chain-transfer (RAFT) process to yield polymeric materials with high

 glass transition temperatures and robust thermal stabilities, especially relative to other potentially biobased alternatives. These lignin-derived compounds were used as a major component in low-dispersity triblock polymers composed of 4-propylsyringyl acrylate

 and n-butyl acrylate (also can be biobased). The resulting PSAs exhibited excellent adhesion to stainless steel without the addition of any tackifier or plasticizer. The 180° peel forces were up to 4 N cm–1, and tack forces were up to 2.5 N cm–1, competitive

Solar photovoltaics (PV) and wind currently represent around seven per cent of the World’s electricity, but

 at current growth rates, including minimal growth rates for fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas, renewables could account for 100 per cent of electricity generation by 2032. Even intensive energy activities associated with heavy industry, aviation and shipping

 could become divorced from fossil fuel by renewable electricity and electrically produced synthetic fuels, plastics and other hydrocarbons. The move to greener energy could have the effect of wiping $19 trillion from fossil fuel revenues by 2040 as the World

 moves to mass electrification, digitalisation, and new technologies, including electric vehicles greater fuel efficiency. It is thought that there may be as many as 540 million electric vehicles by 2040, significantly impacting on the value of crude oil. However

 demand for gas may actually increase. The overall effect will be to lower carbon dioxide emissions by 25 per cent. In preparation for the transition to renewables one leading Spanish based energy generation company recently announced that it was ceasing to

 look for growth in its oil and gas business, and looking reposition itself as an energy company, rather than a fossil fuel producer.","https&%2358;//theconversation.com/solar-pv-and-wind-are-on-track-to-replace-all-coal-oil-and-gas-within-two-decades-94033<br>

The azoles, for example, are used not only for human and animal health care and crop protection but also in antifouling

14316,24/05/2018,mfox,New research from the US highlights how silver nanoparticles can affect the treatment of wastewater.,"The Environment Agency is currently interested in the effects of nanomaterials on the environment. This research team from Oregon suggest that conventional toxicity tests for silver concentrations may result in a false sense of security. Because silver

 has antibacterial properties and when coupled with the beneficial bacteria already in the treatment plant, too many nutrients will end up in the waterways - potentially causing eutrophication. Silver nanoparticles are now present in a range of products and

 are therefore, becoming more common in wastewater treatment plants. Ammonia oxidising bacteria are present in wastewater plants to convert the ammonia to nitrates in order to remove nitrogen from the water. The bacteria create biofilms that can ward off the

 effects of silver however, the ammonia-conversion ability is affected by the time it is exposed to silver for - not the concentration. Because the time that the bacteria are in the plant is greater than the wastewater, over time, there will be an accumulation

 of metal contaminants - including silver. Therefore, the current, short-term, toxicity tests are likely to be underestimating the toxicity risk.",https&%2358;//www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/05/180515092926.htm,"Accumulating over time, even low concentrations of silver can foil wastewater treatment",Science Daily,15/05/2018,,"<p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653518308592?via%3Dihub"">Effects of short- and long-term exposure of silver nanoparticles and silver ions to Nitrosomonas europaea biofilms and planktonic cells - Chemosphere 24/05/2018</a></p>",Error - action required,,,Error - action required,,DFOS,2 - near to realisation,DFOS,nanoparticles &quot;silver nanoparticles&quot; silver metals wastewater &quot;wastewater treatment&quot; ammonia nitrate nitrogen eutrophication &quot;algae blooms&quot; pollution,No,Yes,No,No,No,,Nanoparticles,,,,[],18/05/2022 11:44,"Loveday, Tim",17/05/2021 11:54,"Loveday, Tim",0,,"14,693",,,mfox
14315,24/05/2018,Jason Dinsdale,Recent evidence suggests changing patterns of legal and illegal substance use.,"Societal trends can have an impact on water quality and the biodiversity within them, and therefore may be of some interest to the Environment Agency. A recent television programme ‘Fatberg Autopsy&%2358; Secrets of The Sewers’ found that the majority of a London

 fatberg constituted non-flushable items such as wet wipes. Chemical analysis identified expected substances, such as paracetamol, prescription medications and substances used in skin creams. However there were surprising levels of hormone based gym supplements

 such as hordenine and ostarine, making up more than half of the pharmaceuticals found. Hordenine is in weight loss products, but may also originate from a breakdown of barley based compounds in beer. Ostarine, used as a muscle gain supplement, is a banned

 performance enhancing steroid. Needle exchanges have also seen increased custom for steroid administration, suggesting that this is a growing issue. The impact of hormones and endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) on biodiversity are well documented (%2313140,

 %2311736, %2312214), and further lifestyle choices such as this could exacerbate the issue. However it should be noted that plastic derived oestrogenic compounds were also found in surprisingly high quantities. The results should be treated with caution and may

 not be representative of London as a whole. While younger people may be taking steroids, there is some intelligence that substances like MDMA also known as ecstasy may becoming increasingly popular with the bored middle classes. One newspaper describes a trend

 known as ‘brieing’, where MDMA is taken with cheese at the end of a dinner party to help people ‘open up’ and improve friendships. Ecstasy in powder form attracts a premium and is growing in popularity, further suggesting a change in socio-economic status

 of users. While the impacts of ‘brieing’ on their own are unlikely to deliver any significant environmental impact, this combines with other intelligence on changing permissiveness to illegal substances (%2314524, %2314502, %2313458, %2313654, %2314147) may indicate

 emerging chemical pollutants that need to be considered for their environmental impacts, much as commonplace substances such as caffeine and ibuprofen are currently (%2313198, %2312830, %2311111). It recently came to light that the World's largest producer of legal

 cannabis is the UK, despite the UK Government maintaining that the plant has no medicinal benefits. The conflict within this now exposed situation could mean that legal cannabis based medicines and even recreational uses become commonplace in the future. It

 should be noted that both legal and illegal cannabis production in the United States has been estimated as accounting for one per cent of total energy use, mainly from indoor growing. It is not clear under what conditions legal UK cannabis is grown, but the

 distinction between a household of ten and a household of one - meaning less affluent, large families are paying for water. The sewage systems are also failing with only the rich having flushable toilets. From an agricultural perspective, water was not limited

 quickly enough resulting in both annual and seasonal crops being processed before limitations were imposed. It is suggested that the best course of action would have been to sacrifice the seasonal crops and only irrigate the annual crops. The result is that

 temporary desalination plants had to be built that far outstripped the cost of sacrificing crops.

 there is no global market for water and therefore, no fixed price for trading. If an international market were to develop, even if countries tried to keep the price of domestic water down, an over-inflated international market could force domestic prices up

 as the international market place demands on quality and quantity. In Australia, there is already a value for water and in Victoria, a tightly controlled water market allows water to be moved to more economically productive areas. The Environment Agency may

 grown organically, without direct glyphosate applications. Pressure group Moms Across America financed “Gold Standard” testing using HPLC mass spectronomy. Of the ten brands of wine tested, glyphosate levels were found to vary between 038 ppb to 23.30 ppb,

 including levels of .38 ppb and 3.42 ppb in two organic wines. Similar research on brands of beer revealed that that independent beer and organic beers have higher levels of glyphosate than conventional beer. One possible explanation is that independent and

 organic beer producers tend to use more barley, oats, rye, and wheat and brewing, which may have had more exposure to glyphosate, which is also used as a drying agent, that other ingredients such as hulled white rice. Due to the controls governing grain supply

 for brewing purposes it is concluded that the glyphosate must originate from historic applications in the soil or have been blown in from neighbouring fields. Other recent research has identified high levels of arsenic and heavy metals in some glyphosate based

 herbicides, including the household chemical RoundUp. These have apparently not been previously declared as ingredients, meaning that these potentially toxic substances are being applied to land, with potential consequences for health, land contamination and

14306,22/05/2018,Jason Dinsdale,"There are signals that access to clean water, clean air and a healthy environment, currently considered human rights, may become a paid privilege.","Access to clean water and sanitation is a human right recognised by the United Nations in 2010. However clean water is also a limited resource. The combined pressures of drought, population increase and outdated infrastructure have put tremendous pressure

 on local supplies, and Cape Town could effectively run out of water in the near future. How people respond to this situation is linked to wealth. Richer people could take steps to drill their own boreholes, order deliveries of bottled water or hire desalination

 machines - all at inflated prices. The less well off may be forced to make stark choices between purchasing water and other basics, including food. As the pressures of climate change become more acutely felt on a global scale, the idea of a global water market

 could arise, where countries with plentiful water supplies sell to countries who do not. This could cause the domestic price of water to escalate rapidly. Countries without water would be prepared to pay a premium. This could mean that water is exported to

 where it is most profitable, like gas and oil are, leaving people in home countries also paying more for water. In this situation only the rich will be able to secure access to clean water. There are also signals that access to clean air may similarly come

 with a financial premium. Indoor air quality in China is starting to become a way for businesses and schools to differentiate themselves from competitors. Shanghai’s new Cordis Hongqiao hotel is fitted with filtration technology and accurate air pollution

 monitors in each room, to the effect that indoor air quality is ten times better than outside. Relocation companies are also offering clean indoor air quality provision as one incentive to attract overseas talent to work in China, and many office buildings

 are also pursuing clean indoor air accreditation. Such benefits are likely to only be felt by the wealthy for the immediate future, though it could be expected for indoor air quality technology to trickle down to many more public spaces, shops and factories.

 Indoor air quality may become an additional factor in choosing where to take one’s business, providing one can afford to make a choice. Access to clean air, unlike water, is not a human right, though there are groups out there, including the UN suggesting

 that it should be, as part of the right to access a healthy environment.",https&%2358;//www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/mar/27/china-clean-air-indoor-quality-shanghai-cordis-hongqiao-filters?CMP=fb_gu,How clean indoor air is becoming China's latest luxury must-have,The Guardian,27/03/2018,"Roxburgh, H","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/mar/09/un-moves-towards-recognising-human-right-to-a-healthy-environment"">UN moves towards recognising human right to a healthy environment - The Guardian 09/03/2018</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.washingtonpost.com/news/world/wp/2018/02/23/feature/as-cape-towns-water-runs-out-the-rich-drill-wells-the-poor-worry-about-eating"">Divided by drought - Washington Post 23/02/2018</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.unenvironment.org/news-and-stories/story/right-breathe-clean-air"">The right to breathe clean air - United Nations Environment Programme 01/12/2017</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/will-water-ever-be-worth-more-than-oil"">Will water ever be worth more than oil? - University Of Melbourne 06/03/2018</a></p>",Error - action required,,,Error - action required,,DFOS,2 - near to realisation,DFOS,water air &quot;water resources&quot; pollution pollutant Pm2.5 &quot;human right&quot; &quot;United Nations&quot; economics world market supply demand export import &quot;Cape Town&quot; wealth inequality &quot;air quality&quot; China Shanghai &quot;Cordis Hongqiao&quot; hotel filter indoor outdoor consumer business school privilege technology employment office factory regulation health illness poverty sanitation,No,Yes,No,No,No,,"air quality, water resources, human rights, economics",,,,[],18/05/2022 11:44,"Loveday, Tim",17/05/2021 11:54,"Loveday, Tim",0,,"14,683",,,Jason Dinsdale

To date, some 200 nations have agree to the treaty, which aims to set aside 17 percent of the world’s land in parks

 and other sanctuaries by 2020. The goal of these efforts is to protect biodiversity, or the variability of organisms in planet’s ecosystems. Protected areas are the primary defense against biodiversity loss, but extensive human activity within their boundaries

 can undermine this. Using the most comprehensive global map of human pressure, this study suggests that 6 million square kilometers (32.8%) of protected land is under intense human pressure. Among the pressures infringing on protected spaces are mining, logging,

 farming, the development of roads, the building of power lines and light pollution. For protected areas designated before the Convention on Biological Diversity was ratified in 1992, 55% have since experienced human pressure increases. These increases were

 lowest in large, strict protected areas, showing that they are potentially effective, at least in some nations. The researchers suggest transparent reporting on human pressure within protected areas is now critical, as are global targets aimed at efforts required

 in Japan have found that two key enzymes are critical for plant growth in nitrogen deprived environments. Understanding how these further could pave the way for plants that can thrive in nutrient poor conditions, or alternatively crops that require far less

 applications of fertilisers than currently, which may help to improve associated water quality impacts such as eutrophication. Farming uses 90 per cent of freshwater globally. Altering the gene expression of crops could also reduce water consumption by 25

 per cent, through ‘tricking plants to partially close their stomata during photosynthesis. Successful experiments on tobacco plants promis applications to other important crops. Sorghum is already an important drought tolerant plant. Genetic experimentation

 has produced grains from both types of flower on the sorghum plant (sessile spikelet (SS) and pedicellate spikelets (PS)), which would normally only produce grains from the SS, tripling yields. Application of nitrogen fertilizers delays flowering, leaving

 crops vulnerable to late-season cold weather, which can impair grain development. Only 40 per cent of applied fertiliser is taken up by plants. Recent work on nitrogen transportation in rice has identified nitrogen transporter OsNRT1.1A as affecting nitrogen

 use and flowering time. Genetically altering rice to produce more OsNRT1.1A. The resulting plants grew taller, were greener, and produced more biomass, compared with regular rice grown on the same amount of nitrogen. They also pulled more nitrate and ammonium

 out of their growing medium. In field trials the OsNRT1.1A-overexpressing plants showed 30-60 per cent higher yields in fields with high and low levels of nitrogen fertilization and flowered one to two weeks earlier than the control plants. These examples

 environmental credentials. Hashgraph works by using a gossip protocol. One computer tells another that a transaction has occurred, and then each computer tells another in the network and so on until every node in the network is aware that the transaction has

 happened. In addition to this each message is transmitted with two ‘hashes’ attached that take up almost no additional data. From analysing these it is possible to model how information has spread and when the network reached a consensus that the transaction

 had happened. There isn’t the bottleneck associated with blockchain’s ‘proof of work’, meaning many more transactions can be processed within a certain timeframe. This makes hashgraph more suited to high volume transactions. Baird’s company already have investment

Applying a simulation design in the Community Earth System Model in which CO2 increases are isolated over individual continents, it demonstrates that different circulation, moisture and stability changes arise over each continent due to declines in stomatal conductance and transpiration. The sum of local atmospheric responses over individual

 continents explains the pan-tropical precipitation asymmetry. In other tropical forest regions across Asia and the Indian Ocean, the heating compared to the nearby ocean will enhance a natural ocean-land breeze, pulling in more moisture from these neighboring

This particular research established a link

 between nutrient absorption in the intestine with ZnO nanoparticles in food packaging. ZnO is used in certain canned foods due to its antimicrobial properties and to prevent staining from foods containing sulphur. While it is already established that ZnO can

 kill cells, this research looked at how ZnO impaired cell function. It was found that ZnO remodelled or caused loss of microvilli, the tiny projections on the surface of the intestinal absorptive cells that help to increase the surface area available for absorption.

However, to produce non-negligible transport and mixing, such turbulence must produce eddies at scales comparable to the length scales

 of stratification in the ocean. It has previously been argued that biologically generated turbulence is limited to the scale of the individual animals involved, which would make turbulence created by highly abundant centimetre-scale zooplankton such as krill

 irrelevant to ocean mixing. Swarms of krill migrate daily in vertical columns, feeding at the ocean surface by night, before retreating hundreds of metres deep by day. To assess whether this could have a significant effect on ocean mixing, this study placed

 brine shrimp in vertical tanks filled with salt water, and induced the animals' day/night migrations up and down via lights mimicking the rise and fall of sunlight.  The water flow was filmed with the aid of dyes and tiny glass beads to help visualise the strength of the eddies the swarms generated, which showed that the animals' passing didn't just distribute water in small, localised regions, but churned significant

 volumes of proxy ocean. The results illustrate the potential for marine zooplankton to considerably alter the physical and biogeochemical structure of the water column, with potentially widespread effects owing to their high abundance in climatically important

14257,17/04/2018,jwentworth,A new approach to plant protection involves vaccinating plants against pathogens with double-stranded RNA molecules that can be sprayed directly on the leaves,"Novel technologies are being sought to replace the traditional pesticides used to protect plants, particularly edible plants such as cereals. Emerging strategies for crop protection involve the external treatment of plants with double‐stranded (ds)RNA

 to trigger RNA interference. However, applying this technology in greenhouses and fields depends on dsRNA quality, stability and efficient large‐scale production. RNA interference is an innate defence mechanism of plants, animals and other eukaryotic organisms

 against pathogens. The vaccine can be targeted to the chosen pathogen by using RNA molecules which share sequence identity with the pest's genes and prevents their expression. Double-stranded RNA molecules have been produced through chemical synthesis, both

 as drug molecules and for research purposes, but such production methods are inefficient and expensive for plant protection. This research developed a new production method for double-stranded RNA molecules. The method uses the RNA amplification system of

 a bacteriophage, i.e. a bacteria-destroying virus, and the RNA production takes place in bacterial cells.The study multiplied the dsRNA sequences homologous to tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and the produced TMV‐derived dsRNAs was shown to inhibit TMV propagation

A designer is developing a range of products made from recycled chewing gum. Chewing gum is a problematic waste, but it can be recycled

 if collected. Anna Bullus has developed the infrastructure and industrial connections needed to recycle the synthetic rubber base of chewing gum into a range of plastic and rubber like products, such as reusable cups, shoe soles and wellington boots. Crucially

 her business model revolves around a behaviour change for people, namely using her chewing gum collection containers (also made of recycled chewing gum) when disposing of their gum. Such increasing streaming of waste collection is also a necessary step in

 moving towards a circular economy. Related to this is another startup that is leveraging the potential of animal infrastructure in waste management. Crowded Cities is proposing to train crows to collect cigarette butts from the streets and return them to a

 specially designed collection point called a Crowbar that verifies that a cigarette butt has been returned before rewarding the crows with food. Cigarette butts can pose a risk to the environment as plastic litter but also due to their toxic chemical (HSDBi

 %239602) and metal (HSDBi %2314047) content. However they also show potential for use in construction materials (HSDBi %2314380 &amp; %2314144) and as an energy storage medium (HSDBi %2312800), providing there is a cost effective incentive to collect and separate this waste

 lightweight, liquid thermoplastic resin, called Elium, allows for seamless blending with glass or carbon fibres, enabling recycling at end of life. Elium.generates its own heat which allows fibreglass turbine blades to cure at room temperature without creating

 alternative deep mitigation pathways exist. This study explores alternatives including lifestyle changes, agricultural intensification and lab-grown meat, as well as an even more rapid adoption of renewables and energy efficiency. Some of these have tended

 to be excluded from the scenarios previously used, because they are hard for scientists to model. As integrated assessment models select technologies on the basis of relative costs, they normally concentrate on reduction measures for which reasonable estimates

 of future performance and costs can be made. This implies that some possible response strategies receive less attention, as their future performance is more speculative or their introduction would be based on drivers other than cost, such as lifestyle change

Shipping emissions currently fall outside of the Paris Climate Accord, and EU emissions regulation

 - as air transport emissions used to before falling under Environment Agency administered regulation. Shipping constitutes around three per cent of global carbon emissions. However as terrestrial CO2 emissions decrease this could increase to 17 per cent by

 2050. The cruise ship industry has also come under the spotlight in recent times for the amounts of carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide and other pollutants (a mid-size cruise ship burns through as much as 150 tonnes of fuel a day, emitting as much particulate

 matter as one million cars).Countries such as Norway with a plentiful supply of renewable hydropower and a high demand for short sea journeys are embracing innovations in battery technology to develop electric boats for inshore use where it is easy to charge

 the boats at each end of their short journeys. One electric ferry reduced CO2 emissions by 95 percent and operating costs by 80 percent. And later in 2018 five part EU financed all-electric, driverless, emissions-free barges will ship freight along canals

 linking the ports of Amsterdam, Antwerp, and Rotterdam. Despite these signs decarbonising and electrifying long range ocean going vehicles presents more of a challenge. Aside from the technological challenges the current political climate discourages the move.

 Shipping emissions fall outside of the Paris Agreement. The EU has established monitoring criteria and energy efficiency standards with the International Maritime Organization (IMO) but there has been resistance from the industry, leading to threats from the

 EU to include the sector’s CO2 pollution in its emissions-trading scheme. Previous research (HSDBi %2313624) has suggested that air along coasts contains hazardous nanoparticle pollution from sea traffic and may be responsible for 10,000 premature deaths a year

 hierarchy for staff travel and the future methods used in transporting water samples and other materials, for example. Some companies such as Amazon are already taking steps to move towards using drones (UAVs) for order fulfillment. Recent modelling for two

 US states found that overall electrically powered drones are more efficient on a weight per mile basis than vehicle transportation, but this can vary depending on factors like package weight, urban or rural setting and how power source. Drones tended to be

 more efficient delivering smaller packages in urban settings, even with the footprint of extra supporting infrastructure. However electrically powered vehicles produced less emissions in more rural settings or where package weights were greater. Ride sharing

 services such as Lyft and Uber have also been scrutinised in several US cities.. It was found that, rather than replacing private car journeys, ride sharing was used to take additional journeys, sometimes as a replacement for public transport and even walking.

 Ride sharing also involved ‘dead miles’, passenger-less journeys made on the way to a pick up. Overall vehicle miles traveled (VMT) in cities seem to have grown with the advent on ride sharing apps. Use of these services is also heavily skewed towards the

 young and affluent, potentially reducing the profitability of public transport and jeopardising this service to those not within this demographic. Without a move away from fossil fuel powered vehicles this research suggests that ride sharing may add to vehicle

 emissions in urban areas where ride sharing becomes prevalent. Perhaps in recognition of these impacts, ride sharing company Lyft has recently announced that it is introducing a scheme to offset the carbon emissions of the rides it provides through investments

 in renewable energy, reforestation etc.",https&%2358;//www.citylab.com/transportation/2017/10/the-ride-hailing-effect-more-cars-more-trips-more-miles/542592/,"The ride-hailing effect&%2358; more cars, more trips, more miles",Error - action required,12/10/2017,,"<p><a href=""http&%2358;//planetsave.com/2018/04/20/lyft-launching-program-to-offset-carbon-emissions-of-on-demand-taxi-service-rides-via-green-investments/"">Lyft launching program to offset carbon emissions of on-demand taxi ride service via &quot;green&quot; investments - PlanetSave 20/04/2018</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//itspubs.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/themes/ucdavis/pubs/download_pdf.php?id=2752"">Disruptive transportation&%2358; the adoption, utilization, and impacts of ride-hailing in the United States - University Of California Davis 01/10/2017</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//theconversation.com/delivering-packages-with-drones-might-be-good-for-the-environment-90997"">Delivering packages with drones might be good for the environment - The Conversation 14/02/2018</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-02411-5"">Energy use and life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of drones for commercial package delivery - Nature 13/02/2018</a></p>",Error - action required,,,Error - action required,,DFOS,2 - near to realisation,DFOS,transport energy emission &quot;air quality&quot; &quot;climate change&quot; &quot;carbon dioxide&quot; &quot;greenhouse gas&quot; GHG vehicle &quot;sharing economy&quot; Uber Lyft ride car fossil fuel &quot;electric vehicle&quot; EV drone logistic delivery truck urban rural infrastructure regulation wealth young people &quot;public transport&quot; regulation health pollution pollutant &quot;carbon dioxide&quot; CO2 energy reforestation renewable,No,Yes,No,No,No,,"transport, emissions, regulation",,,,[],18/05/2022 11:44,"Loveday, Tim",17/05/2021 11:53,"Loveday, Tim",0,,"14,622",,,Jason Dinsdale

 cent of emissions, compared to 33 per cent from fossil fuels. Many VOCs aren’t regulated for their contribution to particulate matter in the US. This study highlights where future research may be needed, considering the impact of particulate matter on health.

 Other respiratory impacts from household chemicals have been identified in a long term health study. Long term lung function has been found to decline in people who are more regularly exposed to household cleaning products compared to those who are not. This

 Platform is the only such database in the world that tracks the amount of metals in the urban mine - metals currently in circulation. It reveals, for example, that 20 tonnes of gold goes unrecovered every year, mainly through vehicle scrappage. It is also

 advanced, the quantities of rare earth elements and metals that include gold, cobalt and lithium in our devices will also increase, as will the demand for them. Europe doesn't have significant reserves of these substances and so needs either to rely on imports

 (which has strategic risks) or increase the recycling capacity and move towards a circular economy approach. The outputs from the Urban Mine Platform (produced by the European research project Prosum) could help to accelerate the move towards increased recycling

 but its adoption was hindered by the notion that fossil fuel would be the feedstock, offsetting the cheaper tanker and pipeline transportation costs of ammonia compared to natural gas and oil. The advent of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar,

 plus the growing interest in the hydrogen economy, changes this situation. A Belgian company has proposed a novel ocean based turbine design called a Dualtower. The legs of the turbine are constructed of interlocking gas tanks called “duplex constructive pressure

 vessels”, where one tank is located inside another. The turbine at the top of the tower drives gas extraction and separation technology that stores nitrogen in the outer part of the tanks and hydrogen in the inner parts. Periodically a tanker ship would siphon

 off the nitrogen and hydrogen, and convert it to ammonia on board before returning to port, where the ammonia could be piped to where it is needed and the hydrogen extracted, with minimum alterations needed to existing gas and oil infrastructure. It is feasible

 that other terrestrial sources of ammonia, either from atmospheric extraction or emissions utilisation, could also incorporate similar technology.",https&%2358;//ammoniaindustry.com/renewable-ammonia-energy-harvesting-large-scale-wind/,"Renewable ammonia energy, harvesting large-scale wind",Error - action required,15/03/2018,"Brown, T",&%23160;,Error - action required,,,Error - action required,,DFOS,5 - conceptual,DFOS,energy renewable ammonia hydrogen nitrogen wind turbine Dualtower “duplex constructive pressure vessel” ship electrolysis gas oil &quot;fossil fuel&quot; solar tanker ocean sea pipeline infrastructure battery emission pollution regulation installation pollutant pig poultry air ,No,Yes,No,No,No,,"energy, regulation, emissions",,,,[],18/05/2022 11:44,"Loveday, Tim",17/05/2021 11:53,"Loveday, Tim",0,,"14,609",,,Jason Dinsdale

 Basalt rock contains high levels of silicate minerals that can remove CO2 from the air as they weather. The CO2 dissolved in rainwater naturally gets converted into bicarbonate, which flows away into the ocean. This process has been occuring naturally for

 to counteract changes to soil pH from fertiliser addition. Swapping to basalt would have the same effect with the additional benefit of trapping CO2 from the air. A global application could remove between 0.5 and 4 billion tonnes of CO2 from the air, depending

Genetic engineering could allow organs containing a person’s DNA to be grown in an animal such as a pig. The resultant organ, because it contains the

 human and pig genes have now successfully done the same thing with sheep, again with human organ transplants in mind. The ethics of a possibly growing aspect of agricultural practice, compared to the potential for human benefits may create political tension

 in the UK, should developments take a similar path.An industrial approach to fulfilling organ demand could have some relationship with installations regulation, which currently covers intensive pig farming. Other research has focussed on creating human ‘spare

 parts’ in laboratory conditions, therefore sidestepping the host animal issue. An Israeli company has perfected a technique for growing new bones. Liposuction extracts fat cells from the patient’s body, from which damage control cells are isolated. Following

 growth in a bioreactor to form thousands of tiny, living bone particles called BonoFill, the cells are injected back into the patient, where new bone growth occurs. The technique could be particularly relevant to older people and children with cleft palates.

Ammonia is currently produced using the Haber-Bosch process, which requires high energy

 for heat and pressure, using an iron catalyst. Because of the energy requirements for ammonia production fertilisers tend to be produced at scale and large factories before being transported to the point of use. The developments of these catalysts facilitate

 the prospect of ammonia production at a much smaller scale, and on site, such as a farm. Researchers have found that catalysts of calcium amide with a small amount of added barium (Ba-Ca(NH2)2) with ruthenium nanoparticles immobilised onto it is significantly

 more efficient than current catalysts, allowing ammonia production to occur under 300 degrees Celsius. Another catalyst, lanthanum–cobalt–silicon (LaCoSi), has similar effects. This means that the energy requirements of ammonia production could be significantly

 reduced, bring down costs. Easier ammonia production could also facilitate the move to a hydrogen based energy economy. An ammonia molecule is one nitrogen atom bonded with three hydrogen atoms. As it has high hydrogen content and is a liquid at room temperature,

14201,14/03/2018,Jason Dinsdale,Advances in material science and architecture could see wood used increasingly as a substitute for other materials.,"The Environment Agency may wish to consider the waste management implications of increased wood use, and what this could also mean for land use and forestry. Wood may all become increasingly attractive as an alternative to conventional construction materials

 used in asset construction and management, but with a lower environmental footprint. A newly discovered process has the potential to transform almost any type of wood into a material that is stronger than steel, and other hi tech alloys. The two step process

 increases the density of wood first by boiling it in a solution of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and sodium sulphite (Na2SO3), a chemical treatment similar to one used in paper manufacturing This partially removes lignin and hemicellulose polymers that stiffen a

 plant’s cell walls but leaves cellulose (another natural polymer) intact. The second step involves compression and gentle heating that encourages chemical bonds to form between hydrogen atoms and atoms in adjacent nanofibres of cellulose, greatly strengthening

 the material. The densified wood can be moulded into any shape, making it attractive as a lightweight alternative to metals such as steel, and is more easy to recycle than composite materials. Wood is also the material of choice for a proposed skyscraper in

 Japan, which would be the tallest wooden building in the world, and the tallest in the country. The Tokyo based project is attempting to popularise more use of wood in construction and stimulate the rural economy through increasing the demand for timber. Steel

 is also used in the building with wood incorporated into the structural framework. As sustainability rises up the agenda, wood may gain popularity as a construction material, providing that is also sustainably managed. There may be opportunities to improve

 resilience to soil erosion and run-off.

 Following a high profile, though relatively low capacity battery storage installation in South Australia to mitigate against short term grid failure (HSDBi %2314287), Tesla is committing to a new project in the same state. This one will install solar panels

 with battery storage in 50,000 homes over the next five years to create ‘the world’s largest virtual power plant’. The South Australian government funded project will cost $800 million, financed through investment and electricity sales. The networked Powerwall

 system will charge up when demand and electricity rates are low and discharge when demand and prices are high, providing up to 250 megawatts of energy, 20 per cent of the state’s daily use and apparently equivalent to a coal power station. Tesla has also recently

 struck a deal with a major retailer in the USA to sell it’s home solar and battery system, including it’s Solar Roof tile system, making access (and prices) increasing attractive to the consumer. In the UK a power infrastructure developer has recently signed

AI is increasingly being used in recruitment.

 Examples include video based screening interviews where algorithms are used to shortlist applicants based on their responses and applications that automatically check the veracity of applicant CVs. It is argued that these applications help to remove unconscious

 bias from the interview process, but the anecdotal evidence of one job seeker suggests that using automated technology means that applicants are unprepared and do not receive the feedback they need to improve their prospects. AI may also find uses in dealing

 with workplace conflict. An app called Spot uses an AI based interface to interview victims of workplace discrimination and harassment, creating detailed reports that can be sent anonymously or otherwise, up the management chain. Spot makes sure the right

 questions are asked and doesn’t ask leading questions that can jeopardise investigations. Spot can be accessed by a victim immediately an incident has taken place, an advantage over reporting to a human. Spot also removes any discomfort a victim may have in

 talking directly to someone. The reports also legitimise their complaints and cannot be ignored if part of a process that requires action from management. There is also the opportunity to digitally track and manage workplace harassment to get a better idea

 changes in frogs, for example. The pill in development is based on ouabain, a plant extract used by African warriors as a heart stopping poison. Ouabain disrupts sodium and potassium ions movement through cells through disrupting proteins that transport the

 ions in and out of cells. It is also known to impact on another transporter called α4, which is found only in mature sperm cells. Due to the risk of heart damage ouabain itself is not directly suitable as a contraceptive source, so a chemical derivative of

 ouabain has been created that hinders sperm mobility while being administered. Tests are ongoing in rats currently. There are hormone based male contraceptives nearer to market based on the sex steroids testosterone and progestins, but these come with side

 paid for damage to crops. In recent decades, there has been a rapid increase in the number of large grazing birds - such as geese and cranes - across Europe. Many of these species have benefited from European Union legislation preventing them from being hunted

 in their wintering and breeding sites, as well as improvements in agricultural land quality, giving them access to better forage along their migration routes. On the Scottish island of Islay, for example, the cost of conflict between farmers and good conservation

 is in excess of £1 million a year. Vital to the success of strategies is the perception that changes in management efforts are synchronised relative to changes in impact levels, but the study showed inconsistent patterns of synchrony and asynchrony between

 environmental implications and health impacts, moderate meat consumption is healthy. In some parts of the world meat consumption is encouraged to improve diets. A meat tax may not impact greatly those who can afford meat, and punish those who need to increase

 meat consumption to improve poor diets. Other incentives such as ‘nudges’ may be more effective than a meat tax on its own. However, any strategies to reduce meat consumption could translate to changes in farming practices that may produce different environmental

14185,07/03/2018,jwentworth,Researchers have published a paper providing evidence that a ‘cooling-off effect’ can lead to increased public acceptance of new environmental technologies over time.,"This paper analyses how new information shapes public perception of a controversially discussed technology over time. The public perception of a new environmental technology plays an important role in the development of relevant policy. If a novel technique

 is not acceptable to the general public, it is unlikely to be widely deployed. Acceptance is often measured using one-shot public-perception surveys, in which respondents are asked to state their acceptance at a single point in time. However, there is evidence

 from fields outside environmental technology that public opposition is liable to change over time, often declining as negative emotions ‘cool off’. This study used solar radiation management (SRM), a controversial climate-engineering technique, as a test case.

 SRM seeks to counteract global warming by injecting sulphate aerosols into the stratosphere; while potentially highly effective at reducing global warming, it comes with unknown risks. They found that, following a cooling-off period of either one month, 12

 months, or 18 months, acceptance of SRM increased significantly — and that the longer the cooling-off period, the larger the increase. However, several traits appear to influence individual vulnerability to the cooling-off effect&%2358; groups associated with smaller

 changes in acceptance over time included people who scored higher for reflectivity and patience; men; and individuals with higher levels of education. Overall, the acceptance of more reflective respondents was less likely to increase than that of less reflective

It is therefore of interest to the Environment Agency to explore if such a scheme could provide the necessary incentives for better water resource management

 in the future. California has been experiencing a sustained period of drought over the past few years. The state dictated water conservation goals, but these were met with varying success across the state as different operators such as water companies took

 different approaches. A team at Stanford University have suggested that cap and trade based on local supply and demand issues would be more effective. Such a scheme would help to account for behaviour towards water use. For example wealthier communities tend

 to use more water as they have bigger gardens to water. Putting a price on water use in this way could encourage more social responsibility to water use that could transcend socioeconomic boundaries. Giving water companies targets to meet, rather than imposing

 measures to meet them (such as hosepipe bans) could encourage more innovation in meeting them. Income generated from cap and trade by a community could be used to finance new initiatives that help address water demand in the face of population growth and an

 infrastructure not currently designed for the realities of new norms of climate.",http&%2358;//waterinthewest.stanford.edu/news-events/news-insights/share-wealth-cap-and-trade-system-water-conservation-and-resiliency,Share the wealth&%2358; a cap-and-trade system of water conservation and resiliency?,Error - action required,28/01/2018,"Derouin, S","<p><a href=""http&%2358;//onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017WR020636/full"">Coordinating water conservation efforts through tradable credits&%2358; a proof of concept for drought response in the San Francisco Bay area - Water Resources Research 01/09/2017</a></p>",Error - action required,,,Error - action required,,DFOS,5 - conceptual,DFOS,&quot;water resources&quot; drought &quot;climate change&quot; incident emergency economics &quot;cap and trade&quot; regulation &quot;water company&quot; state government California socioeconomic wealth community demand regulation income behaviour incident emergency,No,Yes,No,No,No,,"water resources, economics",,,,[],18/05/2022 11:44,"Loveday, Tim",17/05/2021 11:52,"Loveday, Tim",0,,"14,561",,,Jason Dinsdale

Clean and renewable hydrogen production is currently tied to electrolysis, where hydrogen

 is extracted from water. This process requires catalysts to make it efficient which are commonly made from rare earth metals such as platinum. Scientists are experimenting with cheaper catalyst materials such as molybdenum sulfide, and hybrid solid-state electrolyzers.

 In this recent experiment scientists produced a nickel and iron nanofoam, a material which resembles a sponge at the atomic level and has a large surface area. Experiments showed that the foam performed better than the more expensive catalysts but for a fraction

 of the cost. While the researchers haven’t outlined their production process they state that the nanofoam can be made cheaply, quickly and can be scaled up to industrial production. The Environment Agency may also wish to consider if disposal of nanofoam may

 present any waste or pollution issues at the end of life, should this method of hydrogen production become realised.",https&%2358;//newatlas.com/nanofoam-cheap-hydrogen-electrolysis/53229/,Metallic nanofoam wrings hydrogen out of water more efficiently,Error - action required,02/02/2018,,"<p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211285517307759?via%3Dihub"">Ultrafine and highly disordered Ni2Fe1 nanofoams enabled highly efficient oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline electrolyte - Nano Energy 07/03/2018</a></p>",Error - action required,,,Error - action required,,DFOS,4 - signficant development needed,DFOS,energy hydrogen electrolysis catalyst platinum &quot;molybdenum sulphide&quot; &quot;hybrid solid-state electrolyzers&quot; nanofoam sponge nickel iron cost efficient water electricity waste pollution pollutant regulation,No,Yes,No,No,No,,"energy, chemistry, regulation",,,,[],18/05/2022 11:44,"Loveday, Tim",17/05/2021 11:52,"Loveday, Tim",0,,"14,560",,,Jason Dinsdale

Several chemicals are used as tracers in water quality monitoring, such as caffeine. Detecting these chemicals

 in water suggests that there is a problem with wastewater pollution somewhere along the line as the source is likely to be man made. Artificial sweeteners such as acesulfame, but also Sucralose in particular are even more stable chemicals in nature, as organisms

 do not recognise these chemicals as food, therefore they aren’t broken down by biological processes during water treatment. Sucralose has been monitored as a tracer chemical previously, but it could also be used as an indicator. If sucralose concentrations

 reach a certain level it suggests that other chemical concentrations are approaching levels where eutrophication can occur. Sucralose levels could also be used to indicate the potential of the formation of disinfection by-products during water treatment. These

 are chemicals formed through the reaction of disinfectants used during water treatment with other compounds in the water to produce potentially toxic substances. Sucralose may also indicate the concentrations of bacteria in wastewater outflow. This could for

 example help to steer policy on how wastewater is impacting on habitats, such coral bleaching. Despite all the potential uses there are concerns that there is little assessment of the environmental impacts of artificial sweeteners. Their chemical stability

 and increasing use means that environmental levels may increase over time. Some studies have suggested that sucralose exposure impacts on aquatic biodiversity, impeding crustacean speed, causing oxidative stress in fish, and interfering with photosynthesis

 in aquatic plants.

Most studies of

 the DNA of extinct species have relied upon mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), since mtDNA occurs in high copy number per cell and is therefore more readily recovered than nuclear DNA from subfossil substrates where aDNA is often highly degraded. High throughput sequencing

 (HTS) has revolutionized the field of aDNA by allowing recovery of these short segments of nuclear DNA. Unlike mtDNA, which is uniparentally inherited and represents only a tiny fraction of the total genomic 'blueprint' in an individual, nuclear DNA can provide

 much more detail concerning the evolutionary history and unique adaptations of extinct species. Extinction of all moa species is thought to have closely followed Polynesian settlement of New Zealand in the late 13th century as the result of direct human exploitation

 compounded by anthropogenic land-use changes and impacts associated with introduced species. The results indicate that the little bush Moa's genes strongly resemble the modern emu’s, which suggests a possible means of recreating a Moa like species by starting

 upwelling regions off the coasts of South America and West Africa. Five countries, China, Spain, Taiwan, Japan and South Korea, accounted for nearly 85% of fishing efforts on the high seas, the regions outside of any country’s exclusive economic zone. Tracking

 MECs consist of glass bottles filled with wastewater, containing graphite and stainless-steel electrodes. Exoelectrogenic bacteria oxidize organic matter in the wastewater, generating electrons that are transported to the positive electrode. When a small voltage

 is applied to the system, the electrons combine with protons in the water at the negative electrode, producing hydrogen gas, which can be syphoned off for energy generation. Bacteria used in the test were able to stand salinity levels of up to 25 per cent.

The

 magnitude of future climate change could be moderated by immediately reducing the amount of CO2 entering the atmosphere as a result of energy generation and by adopting strategies that actively remove CO2 from it. Biogeochemical improvement of soils by adding

 crushed, fast-reacting silicate rocks to croplands is one such CO2-removal strategy. This approach has the potential to improve crop production, increase protection from pests and diseases, and restore soil fertility and structure. Through enhanced rock weathering,

 carbon absorption can be achieved without competing for additional land and water. The crushed rock method also reduces the need for fertilizers and pesticides and decreases the cost of food production. However, there are still obstacles to be surmounted.

 Audited field-scale assessments of the efficacy of CO2 capture are urgently required together with detailed environmental monitoring. A cost-effective way to meet the rock requirements for CO2 removal must be found, possibly involving the recycling of silicate

As the

 world becomes more connected through the internet of things (IOT) there are likely to be increasing numbers of devices, and therefore increasing volumes of electronic waste if repair is not a legal or economically viable option to people. John Deere tractors

 are one of the many companies who use legal action to prevent customers from having the technical knowledge needed for repair, which would otherwise push them to approved repair outlets. Other companies include Apple, Samsung and Tesla. Taking a tractor out

 of action at critical times is expensive and time consuming. Farmers have therefore been turning to pirated diagnostic software and other techniques in order to be able to carry out repairs for themselves at a fraction of the cost. This necessity is building

 into a political movement. 18 states are currently considering “fair repair” bills, which would require manufacturers to sell repair parts and tools to the masses, would require them to make repair manuals available to the public, and would require them to

 provide circumvention tools for software locks that are specifically designed to prevent third party repair. Big Tech is naturally lobbying to prevent this occurring. Companies such as IFIXIT are turning the repair movement into a legitimate business. Their

 business model is to document gadget dismantling and repair via social media, and then sell people the parts and specialist tools needed to do things like replace a smartphone screen. At the heart of their business model is the same right to repair ethos that

 is growing in the US farming community. As a stunt IFIXIT recently ‘tore down’ an iPhone X on the day of release and shared their findings. These stories not only have waste implications but also highlight an example of the influence of a decentralisation

 species richness, composition and ecosystem function are impacted by alien species at multiple spatial scales. Cross-border trade and transport is the principal driver of new species introductions, and knowing which species are where is therefore central to

 evaluating risk to biodiversity and ecosystems, identifying priority species and slowing the rate of new invasions. Across 20 countries used as exemplars GRIIS checklists found 6,414 species listed and 11,320 records; more than 80% of these species had invasive

Computer scientists at the University of Washington have managed to encode data

 using offf-the-shelf conductive thread woven into a fabric. No batteries or power sources are needed. Electromagnetic sensors can read the data, and in a demonstration model how been used for door security as a replacement for ID cards. The fabric can be washed

 and ironed without loss of data. A team from Cambridge University have managed to print fully integrated electronic circuits onto fabric. This is achieved through the ink which contains a mixture of graphene and another conductive material, hexagonal boron

 nitride (h-BN).m This new method betters previous attempts as it does not involve using toxic solvents. The process is scalable and so could readily be applied to commercial manufacture of electronic circuits on textiles. Whilst not strictly an electronics

 application, a team from UCLA have developed a new polymer that produces a cooling effect when a current is fed through. The polymer represents a breakthrough the electrocaloric effect, where applying a current to some materials results in a drop of temperature

 as the molecules in the material ‘suck’energy from the surrounding environment as they attempt to break free from the molecular structure. The results gained from the new polymer are promising enough to consider applications in refrigeration and air conditioning,

The new process relies on a Hybrid Solid Electrolysis Cell (HSOC). A conventional SOC consists of two electrodes and an electrolyte in solid state.   Existing SOECs allow either only one of the hydrogen or oxygen ions to be transported to the other electrode. During water electrolysis SOEC electrolytes transport oxygen at the anode to produce hydrogen. The opposite occurs at the cathode, resulting in

 oxygen production. In the HSOEC the electrolytes can transport both hydrogen and oxygen, allowing both to form at the cathode and anodes, increasing production greatly. The hybrid system also uses less energy. The HSOEC used in these experiments was made of

 perovskite and mixed ionic electrodes, and yielded 1.9 L per hour of hydrogen at a cell voltage of 1.5 V at 700 °C.",http&%2358;//news.unist.ac.kr/a-new-strategy-for-efficient-hydrogen-production/,A new strategy for efficient hydrogen production,Error - action required,15/12/2017,"Hyeon Heo, J","<p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211285517307656"">Hybrid-solid oxide electrolysis cell&%2358; a new strategy for efficient hydrogen production - Nano Energy 02/02/2018</a></p>",Error - action required,,,Error - action required,,DFOS,4 - signficant development needed,DFOS,energy hydrogen electrolysis electrolyte oxygen cathode anode perovskite &quot;Hybrid Solid Electrolysis Cell&quot; HSOC &quot;Solid Electrolysis Cell&quot; HSOC efficiency water resources regulation,No,Yes,No,No,No,,"energy, chemistry, hydrogen",,,,[],18/05/2022 11:44,"Loveday, Tim",17/05/2021 11:52,"Loveday, Tim",0,,"14,531",,,Jason Dinsdale
14153,01/02/2018,Jason Dinsdale,Panasonic is due to start selling household hydrogen fuel cells in the UK in 2018.,"As these systems currently rely on natural gas for power the Environment Agency may wish to consider the overall impacts on the energy sector and related issues such as air quality. Hydrogen fuel cell systems are known as ene farms in Japan, where they

 are already 200,000 home fuel cell systems. The ene farm extracts hydrogen from a natural gas supply. The hydrogen is then mixed with oxygen from the air to produce electricity. Excess heat used to supply a home with hot water. Demand for them is expected

 to grow, since they help reduce carbon dioxide emissions compared with using electricity from power companies. An Ene-Farm can deliver 95 per cent efficiency, compared to the Japanese grid which delivers heat and power with 40% efficiency. Houses running an

 ene farm effectively cut their carbon footprint in half. Households can save money by running it overnight and taking advantage of lower energy prices, and then using the power from the fuel cell during the day. They also offer resilience to power cuts from

 the main grid. Many homes are already connected to the gas grid, meaning that installation and application could potentially be wide reaching. Panasonic aims to sell tens of thousands of units within Europe by the 2020s. A system would cost around 25,000 euros.

 From looking at the current situation in Japan, whilst the technology is sound, the uptake on a wide scale is hampered by economics. That said, applying similar systems in the UK that rely on natural gas could have several implications. It could hamper a move

 away from fossil fuels to renewables as methane gas is needed for feedstock. This could come from onshore gas, anaerobic digestion (AD), and possibly even ammonia, alongside conventional sources, all of which the Environment Agency currently has a regulatory

 the contraceptive pill has fallen by 600,000 from 2011 to 2015, allegedly over fears of links to breast cancer, blood clots and depression. One particular app, called Natural Cycles, has seen its user base grow from 5,000 to 125,000 in a year. The app is based

 on the rhythm method, aka fertility awareness method that uses an awareness of a woman’s natural cycle to know when she is most likely, and unlikely to conceive. A phone app uses an algorithm to monitor this based on body temperature, which can indicate when

 ovulation has occurred. One study has found that Natural Cycles is 93 per cent effective. There are however concerns that using non physical barriers may increase the risk of STDs, played out by recent research that reveals that many young people are less

 likely to practice safe sex with a new partner.

 opportunities to improve regulation. China has recently taken steps to close down the amount of waste it imports from the rest of the world. This is due to the quality of recyclable material not being to a sufficient standard. This is causing many economies

 to rethink their business models on waste disposal. One of the reasons that China rejects waste is to due to insufficient quality - many commodities such as plastic can be contaminated with a range of other waste materials. Unless nations can improve the purity

 of its waste then China won’t take it. Automation may be the answer to this conundrum. While a human worker can pick about 30 pieces of recyclate from a conveyor belt per minute, a new generation of recycling robots can pick 80 pieces a minute using multiple

 arms and image recognition. This technology is generally more expensive than human workers, but China’s stance on poor quality waste imports could mean that the technology is employed sooner. There is in fact one example already in the UK where a robot is

 being used to identify recyclables and sort them. Oregon-based Bulk Handling Systems’ (BHS) Max-AI AQC (Autonomous Quality Control) uses a vision system to identify recyclables and sort them out. The system mirrors the neural framework of the human brain to

 identify recyclables in a similar manner to a person. When the recyclables have been identified by the vision system, a robotic sorter then does the picking.

 blamed for creating issues with body confidence. Health impacts include thickening of heart walls, and an increased risk of developing fatal heart attacks or strokes. Research already exists to show that certain anabolic steroids and pharmaceutical products

 last longer in the environment than previously known. One steroid, trenbolone acetate, along with some other pharmaceutical products, were found to never fully degrade in the environment, and in fact can partially regenerate themselves (HSDBi %2312214, 13223).

 The fact that these chemicals transform, under certain conditions, may mean that they avoid detection, which in turn may account for unexplained observations of endocrine disruption in aquatic organisms. Without a clear assessment of the level of illegal steroid

 use it would be challenging to assess whether this social phenomenon may result in increasing impacts on aquatic wildlife if the steroids are not adequately removed by current water treatment technologies.",http&%2358;//www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/42391438/steroid-abuse-raising-health-risk-for-thousands,Steroid abuse 'raising health risk for thousands',BBC,18/12/2017,,"<p><a href=""http&%2358;//bmjopen.bmj.com/content/4/6/e005275"">Environments, risk and health harms&%2358; a qualitative investigation into the illicit use of anabolic steroids among people using harm reduction services in the UK - British Medical Journal 04/06/2014</a></p><p><a href=""https&%2358;//www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/09/130926142829.htm"">Steroids may persist longer in the environment than expected - Science Daily 26/01/2018</a></p>",Error - action required,,,Error - action required,,DFOS,1 - realised,DFOS,health chemical steroid pollution biodiversity &quot;water quality&quot; anabolic steroid pharmaceutical &quot;trenbolone acetate&quot; zombie degrade regenerate youth young men heart stroke &quot;social media&quot; illegal crime drug narcotic regulation endocrine disruptor EDC cancer muscle image chemical &quot;water quality&quot; pollution pollutant water treatment,No,Yes,No,No,No,,"health, water quality, wildlife",,,,[],18/05/2022 11:44,"Loveday, Tim",17/05/2021 11:52,"Loveday, Tim",0,,"14,524",,,Jason Dinsdale

CCS requires extra energy in current practices, amounting to 16 per cent extra gas use in a natural gas power station. This increase other emissions of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides

Having the technology is not enough, the funding is also needed to develop the green businesses of the future. Currently

 with added risk comes added expense, often pushed on to the consumer or taxpayer, as seen with the push for green energy translating into higher prices. This has led to many questioning why they should be the ones footing the bill when they do not get the

 benefits from profits once the technology becomes established. As the growth of new cryptocurrencies rises, it is envisioned that new green currencies will evolve, making use of smart contracts to incentivise more environmentally friendly behaviour and investment.

 A successful green currency could be something that the Environment Agency wishes to engage with in the future as a way to raise funds for projects or encourage behaviours that benefit the environment. An increase in the rate of uptake of new technologies

The technology is called chemical looping and uses metal oxides under high pressure to burn fossil fuels and biomass without oxygen from air (the metal oxide provides

 the oxygen for the reaction). Whilst not presented as a long-term solution, the research team suggest this process could be used as a stop-gap until renewables are more widely available and affordable. Chemical looping has also been used by the research team

 to produce syngas and could potentially result in the development of carbon dioxide as a raw material for producing a wide array of everyday products.",https&%2358;//www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/01/180102134833.htm,A fossil fuel technology that doesn't pollute,Science Daily,02/01/2018,,&%23160;,Error - action required,,,Error - action required,,DFOS,2 - near to realisation,DFOS,&quot;fossil fuels&quot; &quot;carbon dioxide&quot; CO2 syngas renewables &quot;metal oxides&quot; biomass &quot;shale gas&quot; &quot;chemical looping&quot;,No,Yes,No,No,No,,Fossil fuels,,,,[],18/05/2022 11:44,"Loveday, Tim",17/05/2021 11:52,"Loveday, Tim",0,,"14,506",,,mfox

These systems are currently being tested in new housing schemes in Denmark

 and Norway. If adopted across cities and towns in the UK, this will result in benefits for society as a whole and the Environment Agency as a business. Current models suggest that by installing a district heating grid, heat losses can be reduced by a third

 whilst reducing reliance on peak load sources in the primary district heating grid. This will reduce reliance on fossil fuels and consequently, greenhouse gas emissions. Lower temperature heat distribution systems have three main benefits&%2358; First, providing

 the opportunity to use waste heat from low temperature sources such as fridges in supermarkets; second, providing increased generation capacity and more efficient renewable heat sources such as solar and heat pumps and; third, lower installation and running

 costs.

14127,03/01/2018,mfox,"Pressure exerted by glaciers has an impact on the flow of magma therefore, as the earth warms and glaciers melt, there will be more frequent and bigger volcanic eruptions.","The relationship between magma flow beneath the surface of the earth and glacier pressure not only affects the voids and gaps where magma can flow to the surface but also, how much magma the crust can hold. When compared to periods of time where the earth

 was cooler, it can be seen that as the ice cover increased, the number and intensity of volcanic eruptions decreased. Whilst there was a 600 year time lag between decreasing temperatures and increased volcanic activity, the time difference between increasing

 temperatures and increased volcanic activity appears to be shorter (although the authors do not suggest by how much).
